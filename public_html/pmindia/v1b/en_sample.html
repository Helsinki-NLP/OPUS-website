 &lt;s id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;India is implementing at a rapid pace its highway infrastructure augmentation plans.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;42&quot;&gt;Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi&rsquo;s departure statement prior to attending the G-20 Summit.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;43&quot;&gt;&ldquo;I will be visiting Buenos Aires from 29 November -01 December 2018 to attend the 13th G-20 Summit hosted by Argentina.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;44&quot;&gt;The G-20 seeks to promote multi-faceted cooperation among the twenty largest economies of the world.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;45&quot;&gt;Through the ten years of its existence, G-20 has strived to promote stable and sustainable global growth.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;46&quot;&gt;This objective is of particular significance for developing countries and emerging economies such as India, which is today the fastest growing large economy in the world.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;47&quot;&gt;India&rsquo;s contribution to global economic growth and prosperity underlines our commitment to &ldquo;Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development&rdquo;, which is the theme of the Summit.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;48&quot;&gt;Emerging economies, which played a major role in revitalizing the growth in the global economy pursuant to the financial crisis are today facing unprecedented economic and technological challenges.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;49&quot;&gt;I will highlight the need for reformed multilateralism which reflects the contemporary realities and can effectively strengthen collective action for global good.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;50&quot;&gt;There is also a serious need to strengthen international cooperation and enhance coordinated action against fugitive economic offenders and financing of terrorism.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;58&quot;&gt;At a public meeting, the Prime Minister unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of Foundation Stone of the Rail Coach Refurbishing Karkhana, Sonepat.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;59&quot;&gt;Once complete, this will be a major repair and maintenance facility for rail coaches in the northern region.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;60&quot;&gt;It is being set up using modular and prefabricated construction techniques, modern machinery, and environment-friendly features.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;61&quot;&gt;Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji was one of those social reformers, who made an important contribution for India.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;62&quot;&gt;He described Sir Chhotu Ram as a strong voice for the oppressed and the deprived.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;63&quot;&gt;The Prime Minister said that the Rail Coach Refurbishing Karkhana will contribute to the development of not just Sonepat, but the entire State of Haryana.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;64&quot;&gt;He said it will benefit small entrepreneurs in the region, besides generating employment for youth.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;65&quot;&gt;The Prime Minister mentioned Sir Chhotu Ram&rsquo;s initiatives to provide remunerative prices to farmers, and also spoke of the steps taken by the Union Government in this regard.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;The Prime Minister mentioned success achieved under the &ldquo;Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao&rdquo; scheme.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;69&quot;&gt;He observed that girls born in villages of Haryana are making the country proud in the global arena, and the youth of Haryana is helping make India a global sports power.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;70&quot;&gt;Indian IT talent has been recognized worldwide.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;Indian IT companies have made a name for themselves globally.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;72&quot;&gt;Today, digital technology has emerged as a great enabler.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;73&quot;&gt;It has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;74&quot;&gt;Technology breaks barriers.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;75&quot;&gt;We believe it validates the Indian philosophy of &ldquo;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam&rdquo; &ndash; the world is one family.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;76&quot;&gt;We in India, give primacy to the human face of technology, and are using it to improve what I call, &ldquo;ease of living.&rdquo;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;77&quot;&gt;Empowerment through digital access, is an objective that the Government of India is especially committed to.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;78&quot;&gt;&ldquo;Digital India&rdquo; is the world&rsquo;s largest, technology-led transformative programme which is paving the way for our citizens to avail digital services.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;79&quot;&gt;We are using mobile power or M-power to empower our citizens.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;80&quot;&gt;I am sure most of you are already aware of Aadhaar, which is the unique biometric identity of a person.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;81&quot;&gt;We have used this identity to liberate our people from queues and cumbersome processes.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;82&quot;&gt;Three factors: first, financial inclusion through our Jan-Dhan bank accounts; second, the Aadhaar platform; and third, the Mobile phone, have greatly helped reduce corruption.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;83&quot;&gt;We call this the J.A.M. or JAM trinity.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;84&quot;&gt;Through better targeting of subsidies, the JAM trinity has prevented leakages to the tune of nearly 10 billion dollars so far.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;85&quot;&gt;Let me share a few examples of how digital technology is becoming a great facilitator for &ldquo;ease of living.&rdquo;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;Today, a farmer can access a variety of services, such as soil-testing results, expert advice, and a good price for his produce, at the click of a button.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Digital technology is therefore contributing to increased farm incomes.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;88&quot;&gt;A small entrepreneur can register on the Government e-Marketplace, and bid competitively for supply of goods to the Government.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;89&quot;&gt;As he expands his business, he also contributes to lowering the cost of procurement for Government.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;90&quot;&gt;This leads to increased efficiency, and greater value for public money.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;91&quot;&gt;Pensioners no longer need to present themselves in front of a bank officer, to provide proof of life.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;92&quot;&gt;Today, a pensioner can leverage the Aadhaar biometric platform, to provide this proof with minimal physical effort.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;93&quot;&gt;Women form a significant part of the IT workforce.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;94&quot;&gt;Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;95&quot;&gt;In this way the IT sector has contributed towards gender empowerment.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;96&quot;&gt;We are using the digital domain to facilitate participative governance, or Jan Bhagidari.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;97&quot;&gt;When we assumed office in May 2014, many people, particularly youngsters expressed a keen desire to share their ideas and work for the nation.&lt;/s&gt;
