(src)="1.2"> Freedom of speech or is it blatant abuse of Internet as a channel for expression ? <br>
(trg)="1.3"> 抑或滥用网络表达意见 ？ <br>
<hr>
(src)="2.1"> Just as Malaysian bloggers are getting jittery over seditious commentaries being posted by readers in their blogs , and over their potential legal ramifications , the Singaporean government has decided to charge three bloggers within a week , invoking the Sedition Act . <br>
(trg)="2.3"> 没想到新加坡政府决定在同一个礼拜内以骚动法案起诉三名博客 。 <br>

<hr>
(src)="3.3"> The similarity is that the Muslim-Malay communities are the target of racial slur online ; the difference is : While Muslim-Malays are a 15 % minority in Singapore , they are a 65 % majority in Malaysia . <br>
(trg)="3.8"> 相似处在于回教马来社群在网络上是被诋毁污蔑的目标 ； <br>
<hr>
(src)="3.4"> That makes bloggers ' reactions starkly varied between the two neighbours . <br>
(trg)="4.1"> 九月十二号 ， <br>

(trg)="11.2"> Gan被控经营一个倡导种族主义的博客 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="12.2"> There had been a variety of speculations . <br>
(trg)="12.3"> 有很多种说法 。 <br>
<hr>
(src)="13.1"> The online version believed it was an effort to curtail debate in cyberspace which , because of its vastness , is where the authorities have the most difficulty patrolling or imposing control . <br>
(trg)="13.1"> 网络上有说法认为这是为了要剥夺网络上的争论 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="13.2"> Others suggested the action was actually a move by the authorities to send an indirect message about the limits of political and other discourse that had taken root in cyberspace . <br>
(trg)="13.4"> 也有人认为此举是政府为了间接向网络中的政治及其它领域的言论发放警告 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="14.1"> Both may be true as , on September 17 , the government-owned Singapore Straits Times rolled out an Op-Ed piece by its deputy political editor , Paul Jacob , laying a precursor to an official stance . <br>

<hr>
(src)="16.1"> Yet those who air their diatribe do so in the belief that they are not only anonymous , but also that there are no rules and constraints . <br>
(trg)="18.1"> 所以与其质疑政府为什么要这么做 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="16.2"> This perception is reinforced if site hosts and moderators fail in their duty to act , and if fellow netizens don 't come down hard and fast on them . <br>
(trg)="18.2"> 或是还有没有更适合的法律可以引用 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="17.1"> There are thought to be more than one million active Internet users in Singapore , and the maths would suggest there are more people with the ability to do good and police the system than there are those who preach intolerance , ridicule and call others ' beliefs into question . <br>
(trg)="18.3"> 又或着这是不是一次政治压迫的前奏曲 ， <br>
(trg)="18.4"> 不如由主动的使用者施展力量 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="17.2"> So rather than question why it is that the authorities had to act , or the merits of which is the more appropriate law to use , or whether this is a prelude to a political clampdown , the Internet 's cause will be better served if active users weigh in and do their own clamping down . <br>
(trg)="18.5"> 并且自己将这种情形压制下来 。 <br>

(trg)="21.1"> 如果社群不想要有老大哥在后头监视 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="18.3"> The same day after the Op-Ed was published , Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wasted no time in giving a context to the issue . <br>
(trg)="22.2"> 新加坡总理李显龙随即给了此议题一个适当的背景 。 <br>
<hr>

(trg)="25.2"> 不少新加坡博客说这些违反法律者不值得同情 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="19.1"> Admittedly , there are Singapore bloggers who say the offenders deserved little sympathy because their remarks were repugnant , but the case had triggered concerns that Singapore 's government might be tightening social controls . <br>
(trg)="25.4"> 但是这起案例也引发了新加坡政府可能加强社会控制的疑虑 。 <br>
<hr>
(src)="20.1"> " A part of me is fairly exultant at the fact that two people who ... made extremely racist comments are being punished , " wrote blogger " MercerMachine . " <br>
(trg)="26.1"> “ 一部分的我对于这两个发表极端种族评论的人得到惩罚感到很高兴 ， <br>

(src)="20.2"> " The other part of me is sick at the fact that there isn 't even a pretense of free speech now . " <br>
(trg)="26.4"> 对于现在这样连一点假装出来的言论自由都没了的情形 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="21.1"> " Coup de Grace " was another immediate reflection of bloggers ' reaction just hours after the news broke . <br>

(trg)="30.2"> 他说民众会因为 “ 说出他们的意见 ” 而遭到逮捕这件事吓坏了他 。 <br>
<hr>
(src)="25.1"> Blogger David , a national serviceman in his 20s , said the fact that people can be arrested " for voicing their opinion " struck fear into him . <br>
(trg)="30.3"> “ 人们会说如果我玩弄这些规则 ， <br>

(trg)="32.2"> Benjamin Lee ， <br>

(trg)="32.4"> 他以博客娱乐读者 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="26.2"> Shanghai-based Canadian blogger Myrick observed : " This doesn 't solve the problem of racism , it forces it underground to fester . " <br>
(trg)="32.5"> 但从不涉及种族或文化的敏感问题 。 <br>
<hr>
(src)="27.1"> On the other hand , Benjamin Lee aka Mr Miyagi , who entertained his blog readers without ruffling racial and cultural feathers , told ChannelNewsAsia the following : " A lot of them will be looking at their blogs and wondering if they made any legally seditious remarks . <br>
(trg)="32.6"> 他告诉亚洲新闻频道 ： “ 很多人会开始检视他们的博客 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="27.2"> I think because of the way this will be played up , it 's negative publicity for the Singapore blogging community . " <br>
(trg)="32.9"> 而这对新加坡博客来说是个负面宣传 。 <br>
<hr>
(src)="28.1"> Even satirist Mr Brown had sensed the climate of fear and dished out an advisory : " Publishing race hate in any medium , be it blogs , email , print , tv , radio , or a piece of paper you put on people 's car , is a criminal offence in Singapore , and I believe in many countries , like the UK . <br>
