<hr>
(src)="13.2"> Others suggested the action was actually a move by the authorities to send an indirect message about the limits of political and other discourse that had taken root in cyberspace . <br>
(trg)="14.4"> 也有人認為此舉是政府為了間接向網路中的政治及其他領域的言論發放警告 ， <br>

<hr>
(src)="16.2"> This perception is reinforced if site hosts and moderators fail in their duty to act , and if fellow netizens don 't come down hard and fast on them . <br>
(trg)="17.3"> 要是網站主人及管理者沒有盡責 ， <br>
(trg)="17.4"> 網路公民又不嚴格遵守規矩 ， <br>

(trg)="18.1"> 據說新加坡約有超過一百萬名積極的網路使用者 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="17.2"> So rather than question why it is that the authorities had to act , or the merits of which is the more appropriate law to use , or whether this is a prelude to a political clampdown , the Internet 's cause will be better served if active users weigh in and do their own clamping down . <br>
(trg)="18.3"> 比起那些鼓吹仇視 、 嘲笑 、 以及對別人的信念表示懷疑的份子 ， <br>

<hr>
(src)="18.7"> The Singapore premier was quoted as saying that Singapore takes multi-racial and multi-religious harmony seriously and the government will take action against anyone who makes racist remarks . <br>
(trg)="26.2"> 不少新加坡部落客說這些違反法律者不值得同情 ， <br>
<hr>
(src)="19.1"> Admittedly , there are Singapore bloggers who say the offenders deserved little sympathy because their remarks were repugnant , but the case had triggered concerns that Singapore 's government might be tightening social controls . <br>
(trg)="26.4"> 但是這起案例也引發了新加坡政府可能加強社會控制的疑慮 。 <br>
<hr>
(src)="20.1"> " A part of me is fairly exultant at the fact that two people who ... made extremely racist comments are being punished , " wrote blogger " MercerMachine . " <br>

(src)="21.2"> Admitting that his own blog entries had spoken out against Singapore 's version of affirmative action , " does that make me liable to charges ? " he asked . <br>
(trg)="29.3"> 部落客Zeenie說道 ： 「 我唯一一次聽到 「 騷亂 」 這個字 ， <br>

<hr>
(src)="23.2"> Blogger Zeenie said : " The only ( other ) time I 've heard the word ' sedition ' used was in ( the movie ) Last of the Mohicans . " <br>
(trg)="31.2"> 他說民眾會因為 「 說出他們的意見 」 而遭到逮捕這件事嚇壞了他 。 <br>
<hr>
(src)="24.1"> About the Act , blogger Sammyboy said : " Based on the the list , just about every mother 's son and daughter who has ever posted any messages here will soon be in jail . " <br>
(trg)="32.2"> 住在上海的加拿大部落客Myrick觀察 ： 「 這樣做並無法解決種族主義的問題 ， <br>

(src)="27.1"> On the other hand , Benjamin Lee aka Mr Miyagi , who entertained his blog readers without ruffling racial and cultural feathers , told ChannelNewsAsia the following : " A lot of them will be looking at their blogs and wondering if they made any legally seditious remarks . <br>
