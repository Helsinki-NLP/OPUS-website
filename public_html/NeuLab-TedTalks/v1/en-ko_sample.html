(src)="1"> Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today — we think of financial and economic primarily — the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue — our ability to address modern conflicts as they are , to go to the source of what they 're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them . <br>
(trg)="1"> 오늘날우리가겪고있는문제를야기하는모든결핍들중에서우리는주로재정과경제를생각합니다만 , 제가가장우려하는것들은정치적대화의결핍입니다 . 우리가현대의갈등들을그자체로서논하고 , 그갈등들이진정무엇에관한것이었는지그근원을알아보고 , 그핵심인물들을이해하고 , 그리고그들을상대하는능력말입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> We who are diplomats , we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states . <br>
(trg)="2"> 우리같은외교관들은국가들간의갈등과이슈들에대응하도록훈련받습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> And I can tell you , our agenda is full . <br>
(trg)="3"> 그리고저는여러분에게우리의안건은차고넘친다고말씀드릴수있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> There is trade , there is disarmament , there is cross-border relations . <br>
(trg)="4"> 그중에는무역건도있고 , 군비축소건도있습니다 . 국경을초월한관계들도있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> But the picture is changing , and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene . <br>
(trg)="5"> 하지만상황은변하고있습니다 . 그리고우리는새로운핵심인물들이등장하는것울봅니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6.1"> We loosely call them " " groups . " " <br>
(src)="6.2"> They may represent social , religious , political , economic , military realities . <br>
(trg)="6"> 우리는그들을대략 " " 집단 " " 으로부릅니다 . 그들은사회 , 종교 , 정치 , 경제그리고군 ( 軍 ) 의실체를대변할런지도모릅니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> And we struggle with how to deal with them . <br>
(trg)="7"> 그리고우리는어떻게그들을상대해야할지고민합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> The rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them . <br>
(trg)="8"> 업무규정이있습니다 . 어떻게말하고언제말하고그리고어떻게그들을상대하는지의규정입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today . <br>
(trg)="9.1"> 제가여러분에게슬라이드를보여드리겠습니다 . 갈등들의특징을나타내는슬라이드들입니다 . <br>
(trg)="9.2"> 1946 년부터지금까지말이죠 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict , the ones we used to read about . <br>
(trg)="10"> 여러분은초록색이전통적인국가간의의갈등임을보실수있을겁니다 . 우리가그것에대해읽곤했던것들입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> The red is modern conflict , conflicts within states . <br>
(trg)="11"> 빨간색은현대의갈등입니다 . 국가내에서의의갈등들입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> These are quite different , and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy . <br>
(trg)="12"> 이갈등들은사뭇다릅니다 . 그리고그것들은현대외교에서는파악할수없는것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> And the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries . <br>
(trg)="13"> 그리고이러한핵심인물들의중심은국가들내에서서로다른이해를대변하는단체들입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries . <br>
(trg)="14"> 그리고그들이그들의갈등들을대처하는방법은빠르게다른국가들로퍼져나갑니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> So in a way , it is everybody 's business . <br>
(trg)="15"> 그래서어떤면에서 , 이것은모두의일인것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Another acknowledgment we 've seen during these years , recent years , is that very few of these domestic interstate , intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily . <br>
(trg)="16"> 우리가지난몇년간 , 즉최근몇년간알아낸또다른것은이러한국내의주 ( 州 ) 간의 , 주 ( 州 ) 안의갈등이군사적인방법으로해결될수있는경우는거의없다는것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> They may have to be dealt with with military means , but they cannot be solved by military means . <br>
(trg)="17"> 그것들을군사적인방법으로대응했어야만했을지도모릅니다 . 하지만그것들은군사적인방법들로는해결될수없습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> They need political solutions . <br>
(trg)="18"> 그것들은정치적해결책들이필요합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> And we , therefore , have a problem , because they escape traditional diplomacy . <br>
(trg)="19"> 그러므로문제가생겼습니다 . 그것들은전통적인외교책에서벗어나기때문입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them . <br>
(trg)="20"> 그리고국가들중에는그것들에대응함에있어서꺼리낌이있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Plus , during the last decade , we 've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous . <br>
(trg)="21"> 게다가 , 지난 10 년간우리들은단체들을상대하는것이개념적으로정치적으로위험하다는상태에있었습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> After 9 / 11 , either you were with us or against us . <br>
(trg)="22"> 9.11 사태이후로 , 우리를지지하는쪽이든 , 반대하는쪽이든간에 <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> It was black or white . <br>
(trg)="23"> 이것은흑아니면백이었습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> And groups are very often immediately label terrorists . <br>
(trg)="24"> 그리고단체들은매우빈번히즉각적으로테러리스트로낙인찍혔습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> And who would talk to terrorists ? <br>
(trg)="25"> 그런데누가테러리스트들과이야기하겠습니까 ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> The West , as I would see it , comes out of that decade weakened , because we didn 't understand the group . <br>
(trg)="26"> 제가보기엔 , 서방은지난 10 년을겪어오면서약해졌습니다 . 왜냐하면우리는그집단들을이해하지못했기때문입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> So we 've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others . <br>
(trg)="27"> 그래서우리는더많은시간을그들과왜이야기해선안되는지에초점을두고보냈습니다 . 저희가그들에게어떻게말해야하는지에초점을두기보단말입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> Now I 'm not naive . <br>
(trg)="28"> 이제저는순진하지만은않습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> You cannot talk to everybody all the time . <br>
(trg)="29"> 항상모두에게이야기할수없습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> And there are times you should walk . <br>
(trg)="30"> 그리고자리를떠야만할때도있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> And sometimes military intervention is necessary . <br>
(trg)="31"> 그리고때때로군사적개입이필요하기도합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> I happen to believe that Libya was necessary and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary . <br>
(trg)="32"> 저는리비아사건이필요했었던것이라고믿게되었고그아프가니스탄에서의군사적개입또한필요했던것이라고믿게되었습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> And my country relies on its security through military alliance , that 's clear . <br>
(trg)="33"> 그리고우리나라는국가의안보를군사적동맹에의존하고있습니다 . 그것은분명합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> But still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict . <br>
(trg)="34"> 하지만현대의갈등에대응하고그것을이해하는데있어우리에겐여전히커다란결핍이있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Let us turn to Afghanistan . <br>
(trg)="35"> 아프가니스탄의경우로돌아가봅시다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> 10 years after that military intervention , that country is far from secure . <br>
(trg)="36"> 군사적개입으로부터 10 년후그국가는안보와는거리가멀어졌습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> The situation , to be honest , is very serious . <br>
(trg)="37"> 솔직히말해서 , 상황은매우심각합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> Now again , the military is necessary , but the military is no problem-solver . <br>
(trg)="38"> 자이제다시말씀드리는데 , 군대는필요합니다 . 하지만군대는문제해결자가아닙니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister , I met the commander of ISAF , the international troops . <br>
(trg)="39.1"> 제가 2005 년외무부장관으로서아프가니스탄에왔을때 , 저는 ISAF 의사령관을만났습니다 . <br>
(trg)="39.2"> ISAF ( International Security Assistance Force ) 는국제군입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> And he told me that , " " This can be won militarily , minister . <br>
(trg)="40"> 그리고그는제게 " " 이번건은군사적으로이길수있습니다 , 장관님 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41.1"> We just have to persevere . " " <br>
(src)="41.2"> Now four COM ISAF 's later , we hear a different message : " " This cannot be won militarily . <br>
(trg)="41"> 우리는인내심을가져야만합니다 . " " 라고말했습니다 . 지금 , 4 대 ISAF 의사령관들에게우리는다른메세지를듣습니다 . " " 이것은군사적으로는이길수없습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> We need military presence , but we need to move to politics . <br>
(trg)="42"> 우리는군대의존재가필요합니다 . 하지만우리는정치로나아가야합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> We can only solve this through a political solution . <br>
(trg)="43"> 우리는이것을오로지정치적해결책을통해해결할수있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44.1"> And it is not us who will solve it ; Afghans have to solve it . " " <br>
(src)="44.2"> But then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001 , 2002 . <br>
(trg)="44.1"> 그리고이것을해결할사람은저희가아닙니다 . 아프가니스탄사람이해결해야합니다 . " " 하지만그들은다른정치적과정이필요합니다 . <br>
(trg)="44.2"> 2001 년 , 2002 년에그들에게주어졌던과정과는다른과정말입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> They need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues . <br>
(trg)="45"> 그들은포괄적인과정이필요합니다 . 이매우복잡한사회의실제적인구조가그들의문제들을처리할수있는그런과정말입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Everybody seems to agree with that . <br>
(trg)="46"> 모든사람들은그것에동의하는듯합니다 <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> It was very controversial to say three , four , five years ago . <br>
(trg)="47"> 3 , 4 , 5 년전에는이것을말하는것은논란의여지가많았습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Now everybody agrees . <br>
(trg)="48"> 이제모든사람들은수긍합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> But now , as we prepare to talk , we understand how little we know . <br>
(trg)="49"> 하지만이제 , 우리는대화를준비하면서우리가얼마나아는것이거의없는지를알게되었습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Because we didn 't talk . <br>
(trg)="50"> 왜냐하면우리는대화하지않았기때문입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> We didn 't grasp what was going on . <br>
(trg)="51"> 우리는무엇이진행되고있었는지파악하지못했습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> The International Committee of the Red Cross , the ICRC , is talking to everyone , and it is doing so because it is neutral . <br>
(trg)="52"> 적십자사국제위원회 , 즉 ICRC 는모두에게말합니다 . 그리고적십자사는중립적이기때문에그렇게행동합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> And that 's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict — because they talk . <br>
(trg)="53"> 그리고그것이바로적십자가가아마도현대의갈등을이해하는가장정보를알고있는중요역할자인이유입니다 . 왜냐하면적십자는대화하기때문입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> My point is that you don 't have to be neutral to talk . <br>
(trg)="54"> 제말의요지는여러분이대화를하기위해중립적일필요는없다는것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> And you don 't have to agree when you sit down with the other side . <br>
(trg)="55"> 여러분이상대방과마주앉았을때동의를해야만할필요는없습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> And you can always walk . <br>
(trg)="56"> 그리고여러분은항상자리를뜰수있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> But if you don 't talk , you can 't engage the other side . <br>
(trg)="57"> 하지만만약여러분이대화하지않으신다면 , 여러분은상대방과교섭을할수없습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> And the other side which you 're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree . <br>
(trg)="58"> 그리고여러분이교섭하려고하는상대방은여러분과매우의견을달리하는그런상대방입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59.1"> Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process , " " You don 't make peace with your friends , you make peace with your enemies . " " <br>
(src)="59.2"> It 's hard , but it is necessary . <br>
(trg)="59"> Rabin 수상께선그가 Oslo 협정을체결했을때 " " 여러분은여러분의친구와평화를만드는것이아닙니다 . 여러분은여러분의적들과평화를만드는것입니다 . " " 라고말씀하셨습니다 . 이것은어렵지만 , 필요한과정입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Let me go one step further . <br>
(trg)="60"> 자이제한걸음더나아가보죠 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> This is Tahrir Square . <br>
(trg)="61"> 이곳은 Tahrir Square 입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> There 's a revolution going on . <br>
(trg)="62"> 그곳엔혁명이진행중입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> The Arab Spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter . <br>
(trg)="63"> 아랍의봄은가을을향하고있습니다 . 그리고이젠겨울을향하고있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> It will last for a long , long time . <br>
(trg)="64"> 이는아주오래 , 오랫동안지속될것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> And who knows what it will be called in the end . <br>
(trg)="65"> 그리고결국엔이혁명이어떻게불릴지누가알겠습니까 ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> That 's not the point . <br>
(trg)="66"> 그것이요점이아닙니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> The point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the Arab world , a revolution bottom-up — people 's revolution . <br>
(trg)="67"> 요점은우리가아마도아랍세계의역사상처음으로아래로부터의혁명국민들에의한혁명을지켜본다는것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> Social groups are taking to the streets . <br>
(trg)="68"> 사회단체들은거리로나서고있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> And we find out in the West that we know very little about what 's happening . <br>
(trg)="69"> 그리고서방에서는우리가무슨일이일어나고있는지에대해거의알고있는것이없다는것을깨닫게되었습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> Because we never talk to the people in these countries . <br>
(trg)="70"> 왜냐하면우리는이국가들의사람들과대화를단한번도나눠보지않았기때문입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups , because they were terrorists . <br>
(trg)="71"> 다수의정부들은독재자들의명령을따랐습니다 . 이러한다른단체들고거리를두기위해서입니다 . 왜냐하면그들은테러리스트들이었기때문입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> So now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution , we find out how little we know . <br>
(trg)="72"> 그래서이제그들은거리로나서고있는것입니다 . 그리고우리는그러한민주적혁명에대해경의를표합니다 . 우리는우리가얼마나알고있는것이거의없는지를깨달았습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Right now , the discussion goes , " " Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood ? <br>
(trg)="73"> 자이제 , 토론이시작됩니다 . " " 과연우리는무슬림형제단과대화를해야만하는가 ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Should we talk to Hamas ? <br>
(trg)="74"> 과연우리는 Hamas 와대화해야만하는가 ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="75.1"> If we talk to them , we may legitimize them . " " <br>
(src)="75.2"> I think that is wrong . <br>
(trg)="75"> 만약우리가그들과대화한다면 , 우리는그들을정당화할런지도모릅니다 . 저는그생각이잘못되었다고생각합니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> If you talk in the right way , you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing . <br>
(trg)="76"> 만약여러분이올바른방식으로대화한다면 , 여러분은대화가동의를의미하는것은아니란것을분명히아실수있을겁니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood , as we should , that they must respect minority rights , if we don 't accept majority rights ? <br>
(trg)="77"> 만일우리가다수의권리를인정하지않는다면그들이소수의권리를인정해야만한다고어떻게우리가무슬림동포단에게말할수있겠습니까 ? 우리는그들과대화해야하는데말이지요 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> Because they may turn out to be a majority . <br>
(trg)="78"> 왜냐하면그들은다수가될수도있기때문입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> How can we escape [ having ] a double-standard , if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don 't want to deal with the groups that are representative ? <br>
(trg)="79"> 만약우리가민주주의를설파하면서그리고동시에대표격인조직들을상대하기를원하지않는다면어떻게우리가이중적태도를취하고있다는것에서벗어날수있겠습니까 ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> How will we ever be interlocutors ? <br>
(trg)="80"> 어떻게우리가대화상대자가될수있겠습니까 ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups . <br>
(trg)="81"> 이제제외교관들은이런단체들과대화하기위해서교육을받습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> But talking can be done in different ways . <br>
(trg)="82"> 하지만대화는각양각색으로이루어질수있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level . <br>
(trg)="83"> 우리는외교적인수준에있어서의대화와정치적수준에있어서의대화에있어서차이를둘수있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid . <br>
(trg)="84"> 이제대화는원조와함께또는원조없이이루어질수있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion . <br>
(trg)="85"> 대화는포함하거나포함하지않고이루어질수있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> There 's a big array of the ways of dealing with this . <br>
(trg)="86"> 이런일들을다루는많은방법들이있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come , we will further radicalization , I believe . <br>
(trg)="87"> 그래서만약우리가이런새로운조직들 , 즉몇년이내에뉴스를점령할조직들과대화하기를거절한다면우리는그들이급진적으로나아가게만들게될거라고저는믿습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel . <br>
(trg)="88"> 우리는폭력의행사에서정치로가는길을더힘들게만들것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy , if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states , there are some rewards on the other side . <br>
(trg)="89"> 만일우리가이단체들에게제시를할수없다면만일당신이민주주의를향해나간다면 , 만약당신이국가들간의문명화되고정상적인기준에참여한다면상대방에게는얼마간의보상이있습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="90"> The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this . <br>
(trg)="90"> 여기서역설은이것에대한진전을이루는데있어아마도지난 10 년이잃어버린 10 년이라는것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising — and for one reason primarily . <br>
(trg)="91"> 그리고역설은지난 10 년전의 10 년이매우바람직했다는것입니다 . 주로한가지이유에서말입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> And the reason is what happened in South Africa : Nelson Mandela . <br>
(trg)="92"> 그리고남아프리카공화국에서이루어졌던일의원인은넬슨만델라입니다 <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> When Mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity , if he had told his people , " " It 's time to take up the arms , it 's time to fight , " " he would have been followed . <br>
(trg)="93"> Mandela 가감옥에서 27 년간징역후출소했을때 , 만약그가국민들에게무기를들때가왔습니다 . 싸울때가왔습니다 . " " 라고말했었다면 , 그는지지를받았을것입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> And I think the international community would have said , " " Fair enough . <br>
(trg)="94"> 그리고저는국제사회가 " " 상당히공정하다고보입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="95.1"> It 's their right to fight . " " <br>
(src)="95.2"> Now as you know , Mandela didn 't do that . <br>
(trg)="95"> 그들은싸울권리가있습니다 . " " 라고말했을것이라고생각합니다 . 이젠여러분도아시듯이 , Mandela 는그렇게하지않았습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> In his memoirs , " " Long Road to Freedom , " " he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being , also being a human being . <br>
(trg)="96"> 그의회고록인 " " Long Road to Freedom ( 자유를위한먼여정 ) " " 에서그는수년간의수감기간동안견디어낼수있었던것은그는항상자신의탄압자들도역시하나의인간으로서생각하기로결심했기때문이라고썼습니다 . 하나의인간으로서말입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="97"> So he engaged a political process of dialogue , not as a strategy of the weak , but as a strategy of the strong . <br>
(trg)="97"> 그래서그는약자들의전략으로서가아니라강자들의전략으로서대화의정치적과정에참여했습니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="98"> And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked . <br>
(trg)="98"> 그리고그는일부가장곤란한문제들을해결함으로써심도있게대화에임했습니다 . 사람들이와서대화하는진실과화해의과정을통해서말입니다 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="99"> Now South African friends will know that was very painful . <br>
(trg)="99"> 이제남아프리카공화국사람들은그것이매우고통스러웠다는것을알것입니다 . <br>
