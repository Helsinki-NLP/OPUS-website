<p><hr>
(src)="1"> The work of a transportation commissioner isn 't just about stop signs and traffic signals . <br>
(trg)="1"> 唔係剩係同停車牌 、 交通信號有關 <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> It involves the design of cities and the design of city streets . <br>
(trg)="2"> 佢嘅工作仲包括設計城市同街道 <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> And the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset . <br>
(trg)="3"> 呢種資產係可以升級嘅 <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> You can remake your streets quickly , inexpensively , it can provide immediate benefits , and it can be quite popular . <br>
(trg)="4"> 改造街道可以好快 、 好平可以有即時效果兼且可以係一種潮流 <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> You just need to look at them a little differently . <br>
(trg)="5"> 你只需要換個角度去睇 <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> For the first time in history , most people live in cities , and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years , the population is going to double on the planet . <br>
(trg)="6"> 歷史上第一次大部分人都住喺城市 <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in 2007 . <br>
(trg)="7"> 彭博市長 2007 年提出紐約計畫嘅時候 <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace , and that if we 're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here , we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure . <br>
(trg)="8"> 個計畫指出如果我哋想繼續發展 、 繁榮吸引多一百萬有意移居紐約嘅人移居 <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> This is a picture of Times Square in the ' 50s , and despite all of the technological innovation , cultural changes , political changes , this is Times Square in 2008 . <br>
(trg)="9"> 呢個係上世紀 50 年代嘅時代廣場唔計科技創新 、 文化轉變 、 政治變遷 <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> Not much has changed in those 50 years . <br>
(trg)="10"> 呢 50 年無好大嘅變化 <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> So we worked hard to refocus our agenda , to maximize efficient mobility , providing more room for buses , more room for bikes , more room for people to enjoy the city , and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them . <br>
(trg)="11"> 我哋致力將計畫重新對焦為巴士 、 單車營造更多便利條件令街道安全到每個人都可以用 <br>
<hr>
(src)="24.1"> It 's not great for seniors . <br>
(src)="24.2"> It 's not great for retailers . <br>
(trg)="12"> 對老人家唔好 <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> It 's probably not good for the fire hydrants . <br>
(trg)="13"> 對消防喉都唔好 <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> Certainly not good for the police department . <br>
(trg)="14"> 更加唔好講警察要成日要拉人 <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> So we worked hard to change that balance , and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square . <br>
(trg)="15"> 所以我哋努力解決呢樣嘢可能新方法嘅最好證明就係時代廣場 <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square , and people had tried for years to make changes . <br>
(trg)="16"> 但啲人好多年前就已經想改變一下 <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> They changed signals , they changed lanes , everything they could do to make Times Square work better . <br>
(trg)="17"> 佢哋換路牌 ， 改行車線 <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> It was dangerous , hard to cross the street . <br>
(trg)="18"> 但事與願違 <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> And so , none of those approaches worked , so we took a different approach , a bigger approach , looked at our street differently . <br>
(trg)="19"> 呢啲方法一啲都無用用第二個角度睇街道 <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> And so we did a six-month pilot . <br>
(trg)="20"> 我哋花六個月做事前研究 <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space . <br>
(trg)="21"> 我哋由 42 街至到 47 街封閉 Broadway 劃出新嘅 2.5 英畝嘅行人專用區 <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> And I work for a data-driven mayor , as you probably know . <br>
(trg)="22"> 你哋可能都知 ， 市長非常重視數據 <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> So it was all about the data . <br>
(trg)="23"> 所以 ， 呢個實驗係數據話事 <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> So if it worked better for traffic , if it was better for mobility , if it was safer , better for business , we would keep it , and if it didn 't work , no harm , no foul , we could put it back the way that it was , because these were temporary materials . <br>
(trg)="24"> 如果新做法可以改善交通 、 車流 、 安全對商業有益我哋可以將街道回復返以前嘅樣因為呢啲工程物料只係暫時 <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> And that was a very big part of the buy-in , much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back . <br>
(trg)="25"> 唔要啲嘢可以擺返去 ， 咁就冇傷肝啦 <br>
<hr>
(src)="41.1"> Traffic moved better . <br>
(src)="41.2"> It was much safer . <br>
(trg)="26"> 交通改善咗 ， 路面更加安全 <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> Five new flagship stores opened . <br>
(trg)="27"> 五間新旗艦店進駐 <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> It 's been a total home run . <br>
(trg)="28"> 我哋一次徹徹底底勝利 <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Times Square is now one of the top 10 retail locations on the planet . <br>
(trg)="29"> 今日 ， 時代廣場係全球前十名嘅零售集中地 <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> And this is an important lesson , because it doesn 't need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space . <br>
(trg)="30"> 因為交通同公共空間之間再唔係零和遊戲 <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Every project has its surprises , and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space . <br>
(trg)="31"> 而時代廣場咁多個驚喜入邊其中一個就係啲人好快佔用咗個空間 <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> We put out the orange barrels , and people just materialized immediately into the street . <br>
(trg)="32"> 我哋一移走橙色水桶人就湧入條街 <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> It was like a Star Trek episode , you know ? <br>
(trg)="33"> 好似 Star Trek 裏面嘅情節 <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> They weren 't there before , and then zzzzzt ! <br>
(trg)="34"> 啲人之前都唔係度 <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Where they 'd been , I don 't know , but they were there . <br>
(trg)="35"> 我唔知佢哋之前喺邊 <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us , because the street furniture had not yet arrived . <br>
(trg)="36"> 不過咁樣有個問題因為街上設施仲未送到 <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> So we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of lawn chairs , and we put those lawn chairs out on the street . <br>
(trg)="37"> 於是乎我哋去一間園藝用品店買咗幾百張草坪凳我哋將草坪凳裝設喺街上 <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town . <br>
(trg)="38"> 草坪凳於是成為人討論嘅話題 <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> It wasn 't about that we 'd closed Broadway to cars . <br>
(trg)="39"> 封路唔係重點 <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> " What did you think about the lawn chairs ? " <br>
(trg)="40"> 「 你覺得啲凳點呀 ？ 」 <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> So if you 've got a big , controversial project , think about lawn chairs . <br>
(trg)="41"> 所以如果你手上有一個大型 、 富爭議嘅計劃就諗下嗰啲草坪凳啦 <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> ( Laughter ) This is the final design for Times Square , and it will create a level surface , sidewalk to sidewalk , beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards , creating a great new energy on the street , and we think it 's going to really create a great place , a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name . <br>
(trg)="42"> （ 笑聲 ） 佢會有一個平嘅地面成塊地都係平嘅水晶裝飾會加設喺地板之間我哋覺得呢種設計令到哋方好靚係世界新嘅靚景 ， 名不虛傳咁靚 <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> And we will be cutting the ribbon on this , the first phase , this December . <br>
(trg)="43"> 今年 12 月 <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> With all of our projects , our public space projects , we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces , move the furniture , take care of the plants . <br>
(trg)="44"> 所有工程 、 公共空間項目我哋都有同本地公司佢哋打理空間 、 植物 ， 搬動設施 <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> This is in Bed-Stuy , Brooklyn , and you can see the short leg that was there , used for cars , that 's not really needed . <br>
(trg)="45"> 你可以睇到有畀車用嘅短柱係度 <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> So what we did is we painted over the street , put down epoxy gravel , and connected the triangle to the storefronts on Grand Avenue , created a great new public space , and it 's been great for businesses along Grand Avenue . <br>
(trg)="46"> 所以我哋油曬成條街用環氧樹脂鋪路空間有利 Grand Avenue 嘅舖頭做生意 <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> We did the same thing in DUMBO , in Brooklyn , and this is one of our first projects that we did , and we took an underutilized , pretty dingy-looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend . <br>
(trg)="47"> 呢個係我哋一個早期項目我哋用油漆同花盆 <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> And in the three years since we 've implemented the project , retail sales have increased 172 percent . <br>
(trg)="48"> 項目實行三年內嗰度嘅零售額提高咗 172 % <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> And that 's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood . <br>
(trg)="49"> 係同區嘅兩倍 <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> We 've moved very , very quickly with paint and temporary materials . <br>
(trg)="50"> 利用油漆同物料 ， 我哋嘅進展好快 <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done , we 've done it with paint and temporary materials . <br>
(trg)="51"> 我哋倒不如切實咁用油漆同臨時物料完成佢 <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> And the proof is not in a computer model . <br>
(trg)="52"> 因為方法可唔可行嘅證據唔喺電腦模型入邊 <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> You can have fun with paint . <br>
(trg)="53"> 咁樣仲可以同油漆玩遊戲添 <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> All told , we 've created over 50 pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city . <br>
(trg)="54"> 我哋係紐約 5 個區總共設立咗 50 個新嘅行人專用區 <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> I think one of the successes is in its emulation . <br>
(trg)="55"> 我認為我哋成功嘅其中一個原因 <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> You 're seeing this kind of approach , since we 've painted Times Square , you 've seen this approach in Boston , in Chicago , in San Francisco , in Mexico City , Buenos Aires , you name it . <br>
(trg)="56"> 自從我哋改造時代廣場之後你周圍都可以見到改善工程無論喺波士頓 、 芝加哥三藩市 、 墨西哥城定係布宜諾斯艾利斯 <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> This is actually in Los Angeles , and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets . <br>
(trg)="57"> 佢哋連我哋街上面嘅綠點都抄埋 <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> But I can 't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods . <br>
(trg)="58"> 或者我要好好強調 <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> We also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program , and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York . <br>
(trg)="59"> 我哋六年就已經將單車變成紐約一種交通工具 <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I think it 's fair to say — ( Applause ) — it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike , and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States . <br>
(trg)="60"> 但係宜家紐約已經變成全美其中一個單車城市 <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> This is how it looked in 2013 after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes . <br>
(trg)="61"> 而 2013 年就係咁樣我哋已經興建咗 350 英里長嘅單車徑 <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> I love this because it looks so easy . <br>
(trg)="62"> 我好鐘意呢個 ， 因為佢望落去好簡單 <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> You just click it , and they 're there . <br>
(trg)="63"> 襟一襟滑鼠 ， 佢哋就出現 <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States . <br>
(trg)="64"> 美國第一條單車泊位有保安措施嘅單車徑 <br>
<hr>
(src)="90"> ( Applause ) We protected bikers by floating parking lanes , and it 's been great . <br>
(trg)="65"> 我哋升起泊位保護單車效果非常之好 <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Bike volumes have spiked . <br>
(trg)="66"> 單車數目急升 <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> Injuries to all users , pedestrians , cyclists , drivers , are all down 50 percent . <br>
(trg)="67"> 對於所有人 <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> And we 've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes , and now you 're seeing them pop up all over the country . <br>
(trg)="68"> 同時我哋起咗 30 英里有保安措施嘅單車徑 <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> And you can see here that this strategy has worked . <br>
(trg)="69"> 宜家你喺全美國都可以見到呢啲單車徑起緊 <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> The blue line is the number of cyclists , soaring . <br>
(trg)="70"> 呢度 ， 你可以睇到我哋嘅措施有效代表踩單車人數嘅藍色線不停上升 <br>
<hr>
(src)="98"> After this big expansion , you 've seen no net increase in injuries , and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers . <br>
(trg)="71"> 你會發現係咁大型嘅擴建之後受傷人數無增加到所以事實話畀我哋聽 ， 安全一直喺度 <br>
<hr>
(src)="99"> Not everybody liked the new bike lanes , and there was a lawsuit and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago . <br>
(trg)="72"> 幾年前曾經有過一宗訴訟引起媒體關注 <br>
<hr>
(src)="100.1"> One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on Prospect Park West " " the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip . " " <br>
(src)="100.2"> ( Laughter ) And this is what we had done . <br>
(trg)="73"> 我哋喺 Prospect Park West 嘅單車徑叫做 「 加沙地帶以外最受爭議嘅土地 」 呢啲就係我哋做嘅嘢 <br>
<hr>
(src)="101"> So if you dig below the headlines , though , you 'll see that the people were far ahead of the press , far ahead of the politicians . <br>
(trg)="74"> 所以 ， 如果你繼續讀落去你會發現民眾係走喺傳媒同政客之前 <br>
<hr>
(src)="104"> This summer , we launched Citi Bike , the largest bike share program in the United States , with 6,000 bikes and 330 stations located next to one another . <br>
(trg)="75"> 全美最大嘅單車租用系統我哋有 6000 部單車同 330 個分佈得好近嘅單車站 <br>
<hr>
(src)="105"> Since we 've launched the program , three million trips have been taken . <br>
(trg)="76"> 使用人次已經達到 300 萬 <br>
<hr>
(src)="106"> People have ridden seven million miles . <br>
(trg)="77"> 使用里程達到 700 萬英里 <br>
<hr>
(src)="107"> That 's 280 times around the globe . <br>
(trg)="78"> 足以圍繞地球 280 圈 <br>
<hr>
(src)="108"> And so with this little blue key , you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand new transportation option . <br>
(trg)="79"> 就係呢條細嘅藍色鎖匙你可以踩單車去市區 <br>
<hr>
(src)="113"> The bikes are being used six times a day . <br>
(trg)="80"> 每架單車每日平均使用六次 <br>
<hr>
(src)="114"> And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets . <br>
(trg)="81"> 我諗你平時喺街上都可以睇到租單車踩嘅人 <br>
<hr>
(src)="115"> In the past , it looked like the guy on the left , ninja-clad bike messenger . <br>
(trg)="82"> 著到好似忍者咁嘅單車郵差 <br>
<hr>
(src)="117"> It 's diverse — young , old , black , white , women , kids , all getting on a bike . <br>
(trg)="83"> 女嘅 、 細嘅 ， 都踩住單車 <br>
<hr>
(src)="118"> It 's an affordable , safe , convenient way to get around . <br>
(trg)="84"> 單車每個人都負擔得起 <br>
<hr>
(src)="120"> We 've also brought this approach to our buses , and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America , the slowest bus speeds . <br>
(trg)="85"> 紐約有全北美最大亦係最慢嘅巴士團隊 <br>
<hr>
(src)="122"> And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City , built out six bus rapid transit lines , 57 miles of new speedy bus lanes . <br>
(trg)="86"> 所以我哋著手紐約最塞嘅地方 57 英里長嘅巴士專線 <br>
<hr>
(src)="123"> You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus . <br>
(trg)="87"> 上車前你先喺自動售票處畀錢 <br>
<hr>
(src)="124"> We 've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane , and it 's been a huge success . <br>
(trg)="88"> 我哋劃出巴士專線 ， 唔畀其他車用如果其他車用嗰條線 <br>
<hr>
(src)="125"> I think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched Citi Bike , and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue in my protected bike lane , and I looked over and I saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands , and the traffic was flowing , birds were singing — ( Laughter ) — the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes . <br>
(trg)="89"> 我諗作為交通專員我最鐘意嘅一刻我喺第一大道嘅安全單車徑踩住城市單車嘅單車交通暢通雀仔唱歌 （ 笑聲 ） 巴士喺專線行得好快 <br>
<hr>
(src)="126"> It was just fantastic . <br>
(trg)="90"> 太好啦 <br>
<hr>
(src)="127"> And this is how it looked six years ago . <br>
(trg)="91"> 呢個就係六年前嘅樣 <br>
<hr>
(src)="128"> And so , I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it 's possible to change your streets quickly , it 's not expensive , it can provide immediate benefits , and it can be quite popular . <br>
(trg)="92"> 所以由紐約呢件事我哋知道可以好受歡迎 <br>
<hr>
(src)="129"> You just need to reimagine your streets . <br>
(trg)="93"> 你只需要重新想像下你身邊嘅街道 <br>
<hr>
(src)="130"> They 're hidden in plain sight . <br>
(trg)="94"> 改變就喺街道裏邊 <br>
<hr>
(src)="131"> Thank you . <br>
(trg)="95"> 多謝 <br>
<hr>
