 &lt;s id=&quot;14769&quot;&gt;This week saw the English-language version of Wikipedia, the collaboratively written online encyclopedia, reach 2,000 featured articles with the inclusion of the article El Se&ntilde;or Presidente.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;14770&quot;&gt;Featured articles (FAs) meet Wikipedia's highest standards for quality, accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style, and thus are considered the best articles on Wikipedia.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;14771&quot;&gt;The Wikipedia team that carries out the assessment and quality control before conferring the status of featured articles promoted five articles to FA status at the same time: Walter de Coventre, Maximian, El Se&ntilde;or Presidente, Lord of the Universe, and Red-billed Chough.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;14772&quot;&gt;With five promoted at the same time, conferring the status of 2,000th on one is an arbitrary decision and in some respects any of these articles could actually make a claim to the honour.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;14773&quot;&gt;The professor of the class, Jon Beasley-Murray, began using Wikipedia as a collaborative space where his students could both do coursework and provide a type of virtual public service.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;14774&quot;&gt;Thus, he created a Wikipedia project, Murder Madness and Mayhem, that focussed on creating articles relating to the Latin American literature covered in his class.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;14775&quot;&gt;The Wikinews team contacted Prof. Beasley-Murray, who agreed to be interviewed for this story.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;14776&quot;&gt;Thus far the project has created seven good articles in addition to the 2,000th featured article.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;8960&quot;&gt;Samer al-Issawi, a Palestinian prisoner who went on a hunger strike in an Israeli prison as a protest against his imprisonment, was released on Monday to his home in .&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8961&quot;&gt;Issawi returned Monday to his home in the Issawiyeh neighborhood in East Jerusalem after his release from the Shatta prison in northern Israel.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8962&quot;&gt;Hundreds of people came to welcome him home and celebrate his release, despite an Israeli order given to his family not to have a public party for his arrival.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8963&quot;&gt;After his release, Issawi said during a TV interview, &quot;It is our obligation as freedom fighters to free all the Palestinian political prisoners!&quot;.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8964&quot;&gt;Issawi was arrested in 2002 in , during the by the Israeli army for shooting at Israeli vehicles and reportedly also charged with making pipe bombs.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8965&quot;&gt;He was sentenced to more than 25 years in prison.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8966&quot;&gt;In 2011, during a prisoner exchange deal Israel made with Hamas, Issawi was released along with over a thousand other Palestinian prisoners.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8967&quot;&gt;He was released under restrictive conditions and forbidden to go outside of Jerusalem, his residence.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8968&quot;&gt;However, after only nine months from his release date he was arrested again for breaking the conditions.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8969&quot;&gt;He was required to serve the rest of the 2002 sentence and stay in prison till 2029.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8970&quot;&gt;As a protest against the punishment, Issawi began a publicized hunger strike.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8971&quot;&gt;For more than 260 days he was fed water, vitamins, and additional materials only by infusion.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8972&quot;&gt;According to the Los Angeles Times, Israel decided to start a negotiation lest Issawi's death in the Israeli prison cause violence from the Palestinians in the .&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8973&quot;&gt;In the end, Issawi agreed to stay in the Israeli prison for an additional eight months to serve the administrative arrest he was under and in exchange he stopped his hunger strike.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;13295&quot;&gt;South African media have reported that police staff in South Africa were arrested on allegations of fraud.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13296&quot;&gt;Police said Saturday that nine people including six employees of the South African Police Service were arrested in Mpumalanga.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13297&quot;&gt;A spokesperson for the police service, Captain Leonard Hlathi, said that the other three individuals have resigned from the police.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13298&quot;&gt;Hlathi said that the individuals were arrested for fraud, corruption and theft, and allegedly defrauded South Africa of approximately R2.5-million (about US$327,000) between 2003 and 2007.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13299&quot;&gt;&quot;This was a syndicate that has cost the police service more than R2.5million and we believe we have made a breakthrough,&quot; said Hlathi.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13300&quot;&gt;Hlathi told the South African Press Association that the investigation began in April 2007 and showed that the suspects registered companies in the South Africa police database, though no existing files were found for the companies themselves.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13301&quot;&gt;He said that three out of the five companies were found not to exist.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13302&quot;&gt;The suspects were arrested on Friday by the Mpumalanga organized crime unit.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13303&quot;&gt;&quot;We have a warrant of arrest that we are happy to execute against you right away.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13304&quot;&gt;&quot;You are now under arrest on charges of fraud and you have the right to remain silent if you so wish,&quot; said Superintendent Obed Ngwenya, police organized crime unit head, prior to arresting one of the individuals.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13305&quot;&gt;The individuals arrested appeared in the Nelspruit magistrate's court on Friday.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13306&quot;&gt;They were released with a subsequent court date set for June 21.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;8236&quot;&gt;American Major League Baseball relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain of the New York Yankees returned a call to his sister after an 8-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox Sunday night.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8237&quot;&gt;After speaking with his sister who was in Lincoln, Nebraska, he was in tears and being consoled by manager Joe Girardi.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8238&quot;&gt;Joba's father, Harlan Chamberlain, 55, collapsed at his home in Lincoln, and is currently at St. Elizabeth Regional Medical Center.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8239&quot;&gt;Although the exact nature of his collapse is unknown, Harlan, a full-blooded Winnebago Native American, has struggled with post-polio syndrome since childhood.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8240&quot;&gt;He has been known to be in declining health in recent years.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8241&quot;&gt;Still, Harlan was in attendance at Yankee Stadium during the team's Opening Day series this year.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8242&quot;&gt;He also drove down to Kansas City, only three hours away from Lincoln, when the Yankees visited the Kansas City Royals.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8243&quot;&gt;He made the same trips last year when Joba made his much-anticipated Major League debut.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8244&quot;&gt;Joba has been granted leave from the team to be with his father, and will not be with the Yankees at least during their two-game series against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;13740&quot;&gt;12 firefighters in Buffalo, New York, United States have been taken to the hospital where they are being treated for smoke and chemical inhalation after a massive fire broke out at a warehouse on Buffalo's west side, early Monday morning.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13741&quot;&gt;At least three fire companies started battling the blaze, which engulfed the entire warehouse, sending a plume of smoke into the air which could be seen for several miles, at one point darkening the sky.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13742&quot;&gt;All 12 firefighters are being treated at Erie County Medical Center, but their conditions are not known.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13743&quot;&gt;At least 80 firefighters were reported to be on scene along with a total of nine of the 19 fire companies in Buffalo.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13744&quot;&gt;Firefighters were still on scene as of 9:15 a.m. EDT (UTC-4) today, nearly 24 hours after the fire started.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13745&quot;&gt;The fire started at the Leisure Living Pool Supplies warehouse at 1130 Niagara street between West Ferry and Albany streets behind the Rich Products building at around 10:30 a.m. Monday and was not brought under control until 6:30 a.m. today.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13746&quot;&gt;Firefighters had the fire under control just before 12:00 p.m. Monday, but wind off Lake Erie reignited the fire at around 3:00 p.m.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13747&quot;&gt;At around 7:00 p.m., most of the blaze was under control, but smoke could still be seen coming from the building.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13748&quot;&gt;All employees from both Rich's and the chemical company have been sent home for the day and made it out safely.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13749&quot;&gt;The building is owned by PoolSupplies.com which is a division of Leisure Living, selling supplies, recreation and chemicals for swimming pools.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13750&quot;&gt;At 9:00 p.m., firefighters reported that most of the fire was contained under the collapsed portions of the building, but around 10:00 p.m. firefighters reported that more thick black smoke started to rise from the building.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13751&quot;&gt;Black smoke usually indicates burning, whereas white smoke often indicates water putting out a fire.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13752&quot;&gt;Firefighters are using a helicopter, courtesy of the Erie County Sheriff's Department, that is equipped with infrared cameras in order to see the areas of the building which still contain a significant amount of heat or fire.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13753&quot;&gt;After having fought the fire for over 24 hours, fire officials stated that the fire was mostly extinguished and ordered fire companies to start shutting down the hoses and pack up their equipment.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13754&quot;&gt;Just before 1:00 p.m. the fire command post stated that fire investigators were on scene and that &quot;they can call us (firefighters) back if they need anything.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13755&quot;&gt;Officials have urged all residents near the blaze to stay indoors and to shut all windows and doors due to the smoke which has been blowing close to the ground.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13756&quot;&gt;At least one civilian who was inside a park at the foot of Ferry was also taken to the hospital for smoke and chemical inhalation.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13757&quot;&gt;Officials were able to evacuate the park and no other injuries were reported.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13758&quot;&gt;At one point, the sun was blocked by the black smoke rising from the building.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13759&quot;&gt;It appears it reignited due to the earlier collapse of the roof and the winds off the lake.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13760&quot;&gt;&quot;Right now, one thing fire officials would like to get out and stress is anyone in and around the Niagara and Ferry area, if you could please go indoors, and shut your doors,&quot; stated Michael DeGeorge, a spokesman for the Buffalo Police Department, to reporters.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13761&quot;&gt;The northbound lane of the I-190 expressway, which lies just to the west of the warehouse, was closed at the Porter Street exit at the Peace Bridge to the exit leading to the 198 expressway for several hours.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13762&quot;&gt;At 11:15 p.m., firefighters stated they would begin to reopen the lane.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;13763&quot;&gt;Niagara street from Albany to West Ferry reopened to normal traffic in the late morning hours of Tuesday.&lt;/s&gt;
