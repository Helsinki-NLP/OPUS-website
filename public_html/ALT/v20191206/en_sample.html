 &lt;s id=&quot;12581&quot;&gt;At least seven United Nations peacekeepers are dead, and nearly two dozen wounded, after Janjaweed militants in Darfur, Sudan, ambushed their convoy around 11:45 GMT.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12582&quot;&gt;Five of those troops were from the African nation of Rwanda.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12583&quot;&gt;Troops fought with militants for over two hours after militants ambushed their convoy of 40 armoured vehicles.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12584&quot;&gt;Hafiz Mohammed, who leads the Sudan program at Justice Africa in London, England, says the latest attack reflects the deteriorating security situation on the ground and that everyone in Sudan is at risk of being attacked.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12585&quot;&gt;Instead of actually protecting the civilians, they will end up not able even to protect themselves.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12586&quot;&gt;It's going to discourage countries to contribute to the unit, which is creating problems.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12587&quot;&gt;This is the security situation in Darfur, nobody is immune from being attacked,&quot; said Mohammed.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12588&quot;&gt;The U.N. has condemned the attack releasing a statement saying, &quot;the secretary-general (Ban Ki-moon) condemns in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable act of extreme violence against AU-U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur and calls on the government of Sudan to do its utmost to ensure that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12589&quot;&gt;The peacekeepers are part of a joint African Union-U.N. mission aimed at putting 26,000 troops in the region.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12590&quot;&gt;So far only around 10,000 of that planned mission have been ordered to the region.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;12591&quot;&gt;Countries unwilling to contribute forces, and constant government restrictions from Sudan, have contributed to the slow movement of troops to the region.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;16659&quot;&gt;The month long election campaign in the run up to this weekend's elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo has ended, with a one day break before voting can begin Sunday.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16660&quot;&gt;The fiercely fought campaign began on June 29th and involved no less than 9,707 parliamentary candidates and 33 presidential candidates.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16661&quot;&gt;Canvassing ended yesterday with a mass rally in support of the current president Joseph Kabila.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16662&quot;&gt;Kabila, who became the youngest head of state in Africa in 2001, used his final speech before voting to claim credit for taking the D.R.Congo to its first democratic elections in over 40 years.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16664&quot;&gt;&quot;I can say to you without false modesty: mission accomplished&quot; he told crowds of around 50,000 on Friday, &quot;We've reunited and pacified the country.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16665&quot;&gt;&quot;It is also a message of hope, and for peace and development and security after the polls.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16666&quot;&gt;The international community is taking a keen interest in the elections &mdash; the first since 1961.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16667&quot;&gt;However, the July campaign has been marred by violence and accusations of fraud on all sides.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16668&quot;&gt;International observers, such as the Carter Centre, expressed concern that the incumbent President's domination of the media would undermine the campaign.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16669&quot;&gt;Several hundred people protested at alleged irregularities in the polls on the 18th of July, which ended in 7 people being killed in police clashes.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16670&quot;&gt;This Thursday, 6 people were killed in election related incidents in the capital, Kinshasa, and yesterday, Kabila's presidential guards killed an opposition candidate's bodyguard in a gunfight.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16671&quot;&gt;50,000 polling stations have been set up around the country, for the 25.6 million voters, with over 60,000 Congolese police and 1,700 international observers in place to monitor voting.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;2823&quot;&gt;20-year-old pitching phenom Phil Hughes cruised through hitters in just his second start for the New York Yankees, but the end result created even more frustration for the organization and fans everywhere.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2824&quot;&gt;Hughes retired 19 Texas Rangers without allowing a hit on Tuesday at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2825&quot;&gt;Established big league stars such as Kenny Lofton, Mark Teixeira and Michael Young could not solve the youngster's blazing fastball or sharply biting curve.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2826&quot;&gt;Even as his pitch count rose, the Yankees allowed him to keep firing.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2827&quot;&gt;He was fine, manager Joe Torre said of the 2004 first round draft pick.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2828&quot;&gt;We were going to allow him to go 100 pitches last time, so I didn't think that would be a problem.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2829&quot;&gt;Just when the Yankees thought they found an answer to their early struggles, the organization was treated to an agonizing sight.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2830&quot;&gt;After Teixeira fouled off an 0-2 pitch with one out in the sixth inning, Hughes grabbed his leg, having suffered a hamstring injury.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2831&quot;&gt;His no-hit bid ended there (Texas would break up the no-hitter in the eighth inning off reliever Mike Myers), though he did earn his first big league win in a 10-1 Yankee romp over Texas.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2832&quot;&gt;He walked off the mound under his own power, but will reportedly miss 4-6 weeks.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2833&quot;&gt;He added, &quot;I'm at a point now where our rotation really needs it,&quot; referring to his presence on the New York pitching staff.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2834&quot;&gt;Several Yankees have already voiced their excitement for the righthander's chances in the big leagues.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2835&quot;&gt;For his part, Yankees star Jason Giambi compared him to Roger Clemens during Spring Training: &quot;He looks like a young Rocket.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2836&quot;&gt;The Yankees are currently just 10-14, thanks in large part to injuries that have befallen pitchers Chien-Ming Wang, Mike Mussina, Carl Pavano and Jeff Karstens.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2837&quot;&gt;In a related story from today, the Yankees fired strength and conditioning coach Marty Miller.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;2838&quot;&gt;Reportedly, this was out of general manager Brian Cashman's concern for the alarming number of hamstring injuries so far this season.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;3533-1&quot;&gt;In an interview Saturday, October 21 with Aljazeera.net, Alberto Fernandez, a senior diplomat with the State Department, made the following statement concerning the war in Iraq: &quot;We tried to do our best, but I think there is much room for criticism, because, undoubtedly, there was arrogance and there was stupidity from the United States in Iraq,&quot; &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;3533-2&quot;&gt; Fernandez later apologized, &quot;Upon reading the transcript of my appearance on Al-Jazeera, I realized that I seriously misspoke by using the phrase 'there has been arrogance and stupidity' by the U.S. in Iraq.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;11697&quot;&gt;Afghan officials have said that a rocket apparently fired at a luxury hotel in Kabul injured four people today, despite falling short of its target.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;11698&quot;&gt;An Interior Ministry spokesman, Zamary Bashary, told the Voice of America news agency the rocket exploded on a road between a hospital and the Serena Hotel, which is in the center of the capital, near the presidential palace, government ministries and embassies.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;11699&quot;&gt;The incident happened at about 18.15 local time (13.45 UTC).&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;11700&quot;&gt;&quot;It was a rocket that hit in front of the Rabia Balkhi hospital.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;11701&quot;&gt;&quot;We have four wounded, three are civilians and one is a police officer,&quot; said Zamarai Bashary, a spokesman for the interior ministry, as quoted by the Agence France-Presse news agency.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;11702&quot;&gt;Taliban militants fired rockets at the same hotel last month, which is heavily guarded.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;11703&quot;&gt;No one was injured in that attack, which came on the same day that a suicide-bomb explosion killed five UN staff members and two Afghans at their quarters in another part of Kabul.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;11704&quot;&gt;Taliban militants also attacked the Serena Hotel in January 2008, in a commando-style assault that killed at least eight people.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;8520&quot;&gt;Numerous smuggled artifacts were found at an Austrian tour guide's home.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8521&quot;&gt;Five Italians were arrested and twenty-eight others are now being investigated.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8522&quot;&gt;The Austrian, known as &quot;Mozart&quot; in the art trafficking world, received a citation for his involvement.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8523&quot;&gt;Police claim that some 600 artifacts, which had been illegally excavated, were found.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8524&quot;&gt;Most ranged from 8th century BCE to the 5th century CE.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8525&quot;&gt;Many of the items were gold and silver, along with ceramics.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8526&quot;&gt;One item, a cup, has been valued at several thousand Euros.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8527&quot;&gt;The artifacts were plundered from an archaeological site near Rome by &quot;Mozart&quot; using his tour guide credentials.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;8528&quot;&gt;Italian authorities expect that the plundered artifacts will finally be displayed in Italian museums.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;6029&quot;&gt;Gale force winds ripped through Sydney and the South Coast of New South Wales late on Saturday night, causing widespread damage and extensive power outages, with up to 30,000 homes going without electricity at one point.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;6030&quot;&gt;The strong winds caused trees to be uprooted, in one instance crashing down upon an unsuspecting motorist, killing a man in his 60's and severely injuring his wife.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;6031&quot;&gt;The State Emergency Service (SES) has responded to over 800 calls for help to repair damage caused by the storms, however the storms have subsided somewhat and flood warnings around Bega and Moruya have been withdrawn.&lt;/s&gt;

 &lt;s id=&quot;16716&quot;&gt;Nine people were killed and 31 were injured after a car bomb blew up in the city of Falluja in western Iraq, local officials said.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16717&quot;&gt;This is the second bomb blast in the Anbar province within the past few days.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16718&quot;&gt;Six people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated explosives at a funeral in Haditha on Monday.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16719&quot;&gt;&quot;Security forces are still looking for victims under the rubble,&quot; said the head of the Amiriya local municipal council, Shaker al-Issawi.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16720&quot;&gt;According to reports from witnesses, the blast was so strong that it threw bodies onto rooftops of neighbouring buildings.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16721&quot;&gt;Unlike previous such explosions, this explosion did not appear to be set by a suicide bomber.&lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s id=&quot;16722&quot;&gt;A witness near where the car bomb exploded said that a man had parked a blue truck, and left it a quarter of an hour before it exploded.&lt;/s&gt;
