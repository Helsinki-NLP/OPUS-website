Criticism was targeted to Government efforts in the affair of the Jian Seng in the Australian Senate March 28 and 29 over the handling of the ghost ship, the tanker Jian Seng, which was found abandoned and unlit in the Gulf of Carpentaria.<br/>
3月28日和29日，澳大利亚参议院就“建胜”号幽灵船的处理问题对政府在“建胜”号事件中的努力提出了批评，这艘名为“建胜”的油轮，在卡本塔利亚湾被发现时被遗弃且没有亮灯。<br/>
<hr/>
Senator Joe Ludwig (Labor, Queensland) asked of the Minister for Justice and Customs Senator Chris Ellison in Question Time whether he stood by his claim that he made yesterday that the discovery of the Jian Seng demonstrated that the Australian Government had in place "aerial and maritime surveillance to intercept a vessel in these circumstances, and that was done", and asked why it took the Government two weeks to intercept the vessel after it entered Australian waters.<br/>
参议员乔·路德维希（工党，昆士兰）在接受《时代》周刊采访时，问司法和海关部长克里斯·埃里森，他是否坚持自己昨天的说法，即“建胜号”的发现，表明澳大利亚政府“在这种情况下进行了空中和海上监视，拦截了一艘船只，而且确实做到了”。并询问为什么政府在这艘船进入澳大利亚水域后花了两周时间拦截它。<br/>
<hr/>
Senator Ellison responded that at the vessel's first sighting on March 8 "it was not doing anything illegal", and criticised the Opposition's claim that the ship was drifting for seventeen days, saying that "it was not stated as having drifted for the whole of the 17 days".<br/>
埃里森参议员回应称，该船于3月8日首次发现“它没有采取任何违法行为”，并批评反对派声称这艘船漂流了17天，并说“没有说明这艘船漂流了整整17天”。<br/>
<hr/>
Ludwig went on to note that it was not Customs that spotted the ship but a "passing Australian barge", but Ellison had defended this, stating that Ludwig "thinks that commercial vessels have absolutely no role in looking out for Australia" and that Ellison will "rely on reports to our hotline and go out and inspect vessels".<br/>
路德维希接着指出，发现这艘船的不是海关，而是一艘“经过澳大利亚的驳船”，但埃利森对此进行了辩护，他说，路德维希“认为商业船只在为澳大利亚着想方面完全没有什么作用”，埃利森将“依靠向我们的热线报告，出海检查船只”。<br/>
<hr/>
Later, Senator Kerry O'Brien (Labor, Tasmania) criticised the Government's implementation of coastal defense, and highlighted the dangers of ignoring the ship for seventeen days, saying that "it posed and possibly still poses unknown environmental and quarantine risks" and that the Jian Seng "has been refused admission to Weipa harbour...It could have been carrying literally anything."<br/>
后来，参议员克里·奥布莱恩（工党，塔斯马尼亚州）批评政府实施沿海防御的做法，并强调忽视这艘船17天的危险，说“它构成了而且可能仍然构成未知的环境和检疫风险”，并说建胜号“已被拒绝进入威帕港……它可能携带了任何东西。”<br/>
<hr/>
Senator David Johnston (Liberal, Western Australia) went on to debate that there are no shipping lanes in the area where the Jian Seng was found, and that devoting resources to a harmless ship would leave gaps in the coastal defenses elsewhere.<br/>
参议员约翰斯顿（自由党，西澳大利亚）继续辩论说，在“建胜”号被发现的海域没有航道，把资源投入一艘无害的船只，会给其他地方的海防留下缺口。<br/>
<hr/>
