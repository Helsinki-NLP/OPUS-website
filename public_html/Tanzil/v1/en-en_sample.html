(trg)="s2.33.2"> And I know all what you disclose and all what you hide ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.34"> Remember , when We asked the angels to bow in homage to Adam , they all bowed but Iblis , who disdained and turned insolent , and so became a disbeliever . <br>
(trg)="s2.34"> And ( remember ) when We ordered the angels to prostrate before Adam , so they all prostrated , except Iblis ( Satan devil – ) ; he refused and was proud – and became a disbeliever . <br>

(src)="s2.36.0"> But Satan tempted them and had them banished from the ( happy ) state they were in . <br>
(src)="s2.36.1"> And We said : " Go , one the antagonist of the other , and live on the earth for a time ordained , and fend for yourselves . " <br>
(trg)="s2.36"> So the devil destabilised them in it and removed them from where they were – and We said , “ Go down , one of you is an enemy to the other ; and for a fixed time you shall stay on earth and feed in it . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.37"> Then his Lord sent commands to Adam and turned towards him : Indeed He is compassionate and kind . <br>
(trg)="s2.37.0"> Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain words ( of revelation ) , therefore Allah accepted his repentance ; indeed He only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance , the Most Merciful . <br>
(trg)="s2.37.1"> ( See Verse 7 : 23 ) <br>

(src)="s2.64"> But you went back ( on your word ) , and but for the mercy and grace of God you were lost . <br>
(trg)="s2.64"> Then after that , you turned away ; and were it not for the munificence of Allah and His mercy , you would be among the losers . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.65"> You know and have known already those among you who had broken the sanctity of the Sabbath , and to whom We had said : " Become ( like ) apes despised , " <br>
(trg)="s2.65"> And you certainly know of those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of Sabth ( Sabbath – Saturday ) – We therefore said to them , “ Become apes , despised ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.66"> And whom We made an example for the people ( of the day ) and those after them , and warning for those who fear God . <br>
(trg)="s2.66"> So We made this incident ( of that town ) a warning to the surrounding towns ( others of their time ) and to succeeding generations , and a lesson for the pious . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.67.0"> Remember , when Moses said to his people : " God demands that you sacrifice a cow , " they said : " Are you making fun of us ? " <br>
(trg)="s2.67.0"> And ( remember ) when Moosa said to his people , “ Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow ” ; they said , “ Are you making fun of us ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.67.1"> And he said : " God forbid that I be of the ignorant . " <br>
(trg)="s2.67.1"> He answered , “ Allah forbid that I should be of the ignorant ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.68.0"> " Call on your Lord for us , " they said , " that He might inform us what kind she should be . " <br>
(src)="s2.68.1"> " Neither old nor young , says God , but of age in between , " answered Moses . <br>
(src)="s2.68.2"> " So do as you are bid . " <br>
(trg)="s2.68"> They said , “ Pray to your Lord that He may describe the cow ; ” said Moosa , “ He says that it is a cow neither old nor very young but between the two conditions ; so do what you are commanded . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.69.0"> " Call on your Lord , " they said , " to tell us the colour of the cow . " <br>
(src)="s2.69.1"> " God says , " answered Moses , " a fawn coloured cow , rich yellow , well pleasing to the eye . " <br>
(trg)="s2.69"> They said , “ Pray to your Lord that He may reveal its colour to us ” ; answered Moosa , “ Indeed He says it is a yellow cow , of bright colour , pleasing to the beholders . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.70.0"> " Call on your Lord , " they said , " to name its variety , as cows be all alike to us . <br>
(src)="s2.70.1"> If God wills we shall be guided aright . " <br>
(trg)="s2.70"> They said , “ Pray to your Lord that He may clearly describe the cow to us , we are really in a doubt as to which cow it is ; and if Allah wills , we will attain guidance . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.71.0"> And Moses said : " He says it 's a cow unyoked , nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields , one in good shape with no mark or blemish . " <br>
(src)="s2.71.1"> " Now have you brought us the truth , " they said ; and then , after wavering , they sacrificed the cow . <br>
(trg)="s2.71"> Said Moosa , “ He says , ‘ She is a cow not made to work , neither ploughing the soil nor watering the fields ; flawless and spotless ’ ; they said , “ You have now conveyed the proper fact ” ; so they sacrificed it , but seemed not to be sacrificing it ( with sincerity ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.72"> Remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed , God brought to light what you concealed . <br>
(trg)="s2.72"> And ( remember ) when you slew a man and were therefore accusing each other concerning it ; and Allah wanted to expose what you were hiding . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.73.0"> We had pronounced already : " Slay ( the murderer ) for ( taking a life ) . " <br>
(src)="s2.73.1"> Thus God preserves life from death and shows you His signs that you may understand . <br>
(trg)="s2.73"> We therefore said , “ Strike the dead man with a part of the sacrificed cow ” ; this is how Allah will bring the dead to life , and shows you His signs so that you may understand ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.74.0"> Yet , in spite of this , your hearts only hardened like rocks or even harder , but among rocks are those from which rivers flow ; and there are also those which split open and water gushes forth ; as well as those that roll down for fear of God . <br>
(src)="s2.74.1"> And God is not negligent of all that you do . <br>
(trg)="s2.74"> Then after it , your hearts hardened – so they are like rocks , or even harder ; for there are some rocks that rivers gush forth from them ; and some that water flows from them when they split asunder ; and there are rocks that fall down for the fear of Allah ; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.75"> How do you expect them to put their faith in you , when you know that some among them heard the word of God and , having understood , perverted it knowingly ? <br>
(trg)="s2.75"> So O Muslims , do you wish for the Jews to accept faith in you whereas a group of them used to listen to the Words of Allah , and then after having understood it , purposely changed it ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.76.0"> For when they meet the faithful , they say : " We believe ; " but when among themselves , they say : " Why do you tell them what the Lord has revealed to you ? <br>
(src)="s2.76.1"> They will only dispute it in the presence of your Lord . <br>
(trg)="s2.76.0"> And when they meet the believers , they say , “ We believe ” ; but when they are in isolation with one another they say , “ You clarify to the believers from what Allah has disclosed to you , so that they may evidence it against you before your Lord ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.76.2"> Have you no sense indeed ? " <br>
(trg)="s2.76.1"> So have you no sense ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.77"> Do they not know that God is aware of what they hide and what they disclose ? <br>
(trg)="s2.77"> Do they not know that Allah knows all whatever they hide and whatever they disclose ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.78"> Among them are heathens who know nothing of the Book but only what they wish to believe , and are only lost in fantasies . <br>
(trg)="s2.78"> And among them are the unlearned that do not know anything of the Book except to recite something therefrom or parts of their own fabrications ; they are in absolute illusion . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.79"> But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say : " This is from God , " so that they might earn some profit thereby ; and woe to them for what they fake , and woe to them for what they earn from it ! <br>
(trg)="s2.79"> Therefore woe is to those who write the Book with their hands ; and they then claim , “ This is from Allah ” in order to gain an abject ( worldly ) price for it ; therefore woe to them for what their hands have written , and woe to them for what they earn with it . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.80.0"> Yet they say : " The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days . " <br>
(src)="s2.80.1"> Say .. <br>
(src)="s2.80.2"> " Have you so received a promise from God ? " <br>
(src)="s2.80.3"> " Then surely God will not withdraw His pledge . <br>
(src)="s2.80.4"> Or do you impute things to God of which you have no knowledge at all ? " <br>
(trg)="s2.80"> And they said , “ The fire will not touch us except for a certain number of days ” ; say , “ Have you taken a covenant from Allah then – Allah will certainly not break His covenant – or do you say something concerning Allah what you do not know ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.81"> Why , they who have earned the wages of sin and are enclosed in error , are people of Hell , where they will abide for ever . <br>
(trg)="s2.81.0"> Yes , why not ? * The one who earns evil and his sin surrounds him ; he is from the people of fire ( hell ) ; they will remain in it forever . <br>
(trg)="s2.81.1"> ( You will remain in the fire forever ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.82"> But those who believe and do good deeds are people of Paradise , and shall live there forever . <br>
(trg)="s2.82"> And those who believe and do good deeds – they are the People of Paradise ; they will abide in it forever . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.83"> Remember , when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said : " Worship no one but God , and be good to your parents and your kin , and to orphans and the needy , and speak of goodness to men ; observe your devotional obligations , and give zakat ( the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others ) , " you went back ( on your word ) , except only a few , and paid no heed . <br>
(trg)="s2.83"> And ( remember ) when We took a covenant from the Descendants of Israel that , “ Do not worship anyone except Allah ; and be good to parents , relatives , orphans and the needy , and speak kindly to people and keep the prayer established and pay the charity ; ” thereafter you retracted , except some of you ; and you are those who turn away . <br>
