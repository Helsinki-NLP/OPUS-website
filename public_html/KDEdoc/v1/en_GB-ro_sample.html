(src)="s3.1"> KDE is a desktop environment . <br>
(trg)="s2.1"> Ce este KDE ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="s3.2"> In other words , KDE is a collection of programs , technologies and documentation that attempt to make life easier for computer users . <br>
(src)="s3.3"> KDE is targeted at UNIX workstations . <br>
(trg)="s3.1"> Mediul grafic KDE <br>

(src)="s3.4"> It features network transparency and a contemporary work philosophy . <br>
(src)="s4.1"> The creators of the K Desktop Environment are a world-wide group of software engineers . <br>
(trg)="s4.1"> While there will always be room for improvement we believe we have now delivered a viable alternative to some of the more commonly found and commercial operating systems / desktops combinations available today . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s4.2"> This group's major goal in free software development is to provide high quality software that empowers the user with easy control of his computer's resources . <br>
(src)="s5.1"> KDE seeks to fill the need for an easy to use desktop for UNIX workstations , similar to the desktop environments found under the Mac OS or Windows 95/NT . <br>
(trg)="s4.2"> It is our hope that the combination of Unix and KDE will finally bring the same open , reliable , stable , and monopoly free computing to the average computer user , that scientists and computing professionals world-wide have enjoyed for years . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s5.2"> KDE fills the need of users for an easy to use work environment . <br>
(trg)="s5.1"> KDE The Application Development Framework <br>
<hr>
(src)="s5.3"> Tools used to reach this end are : enhanced inter-application communication , component reuse , generalised drag and drop , uniform look and feel and many more . <br>
(src)="s5.4"> Thus , KDE offers much more than the traditional UNIX window managers . <br>
(trg)="s6.1"> KDE focuses on the user' s needs , but it 's obvious that this focus is more easily achieved by also giving developers the best tools . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s6.1"> Stability , scaleability and openness are qualities which have made UNIX the undisputed choice for the information technology professional for many years . <br>
(src)="s6.2"> KDE builds on top of this excellent base framework and brings new , much needed qualities : usability , user friendliness and beauty ! <br>
(trg)="s6.2"> KDE code contains , and comes with some of the best development technologies of the modern computing age . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s6.3"> KDE was the first , and stays the forefront player in bringing these qualities to UNIX , which constituted for years , the premier platform for server computers and scientific institutions , but wasn't very attractive for desktop users . <br>
(src)="s7.1"> Without UNIX the Internet would not exist , or at least would have a vastly different form . <br>
(trg)="s7.1"> Authoring applications under Unix / X11 used to be an extremely tedious and labor intensive process . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s7.2"> UNIX has not , until now , addressed the needs of the average computer user . <br>
(src)="s7.3"> This fact is particularly unfortunate , since a number of implementations of UNIX ( Linux , FreeBSD , NetBSD , etc. ) are freely available on the Internet , all of which are of exceptional quality and stability . <br>
(trg)="s7.2"> KDE recognizes the fact that a computing platform is only as good as the amount of first class applications available to the users of that particular platform . <br>
<hr>
(src)="s8.1"> KDE The Desktop Environment <br>
(src)="s9.1"> In combination with a free implementation of UNIX , KDE provides to the world an open and completely free desktop computing platform either at home or at work . <br>

(src)="s13.2"> KDE code contains , and comes with , some of the best development technologies of the modern computing age . <br>
(trg)="s9.1"> In view of these circumstances the KDE Project has developed a first rate compound document application framework , implementing the latest advances in framework technology and thus positioning itself in direct competition to such popular development frameworks as for example Mircrosoft ' s MFC / COM / ActiveX technology . <br>

(src)="s17.1"> In its current form , KDE provides , apart from the essential desktop component applications , a suite of powerful office programs known to the world by the name KOffice . <br>
(trg)="s11.2"> It contains presently : a word processor with desktop publishing capabilities ( KWord ) , a spreadsheet application ( KSpread ) and accompanying Charting program ( KChart ) , a presentation program ( KPresenter ) and a vector drawing program ( KIllustrator ) . <br>
