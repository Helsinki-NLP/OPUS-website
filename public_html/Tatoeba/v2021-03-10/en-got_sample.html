<p>
I have to go to sleep. <br/>
𐍃𐌺𐌰𐌻 𐍃𐌻𐌴𐍀𐌰𐌽. <br/>
<hr/>
I was in the mountains. <br/>
𐌹𐌺 𐍅𐌰𐍃 𐌹𐌽 𐌸𐌰𐌼𐌼𐌰 𐍆𐌰𐌹𐍂𐌲𐌿𐌽𐌾𐌰𐌼. <br/>
<hr/>
That won't happen. <br/>
𐌸𐌰𐍄𐌰 𐌽𐌹 𐌰𐌹𐍅 𐍅𐌰𐌹𐍂𐌸𐌹𐌸. <br/>
<hr/>
You should sleep. <br/>
𐌸𐌿 𐍃𐌺𐌰𐌻𐍄 𐍃𐌻𐌴𐍀𐌰𐌽. <br/>
<hr/>
I'm going to go. <br/>
𐌹𐌺 𐌲𐌰𐌲𐌲𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
No I'm not; you are! <br/>
𐌽𐌹 𐌹𐌺, 𐌰𐌺 𐌸𐌿! <br/>
<hr/>
When I grow up, I want to be a king. <br/>
𐌱𐌹𐌸𐌴 𐌿𐍃𐌰𐌻𐌸𐌰, 𐍅𐌹𐌻𐌾𐌰𐌿 𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌰𐌽𐍃 𐍅𐌹𐍃𐌰𐌽. <br/>
<hr/>
This is what I would have said. <br/>
𐌸𐌰𐍄𐌿𐌷 𐌹𐍃𐍄 𐍈𐌰 𐌹𐌺 𐌵𐌴𐌸𐌾𐌰𐌿. <br/>
<hr/>
When I woke up, I was sad. <br/>
𐌱𐌹𐌸𐌴 𐌹𐌺 𐌿𐍃𐍅𐌰𐌺𐌹𐌳𐌰, 𐌲𐌰𐌿𐍂𐍃 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌸. <br/>
<hr/>
Why do you ask? <br/>
𐌳𐌿𐍈𐌴 𐍆𐍂𐌰𐌹𐌷𐌽𐌹𐍃? <br/>
<hr/>
I didn't know where it came from. <br/>
𐌽𐌹 𐍅𐌹𐍃𐍃𐌰 𐍈𐌰𐌸𐍂𐍉 𐌵𐌰𐌼. <br/>
<hr/>
You can do it. <br/>
𐌸𐌿 𐌼𐌰𐌲𐍄 𐍄𐌰𐌿𐌾𐌰𐌽 𐌹𐍄𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
I don't know what you mean. <br/>
𐌽𐌹 𐍅𐌰𐌹𐍄 𐍈𐌰 𐌼𐌿𐌽𐌰𐌹𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
There are many words that I don't understand. <br/>
𐍃𐌹𐌽𐌳 𐍆𐌹𐌻𐌿 𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌴 𐌸𐌰𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌹 𐌽𐌹 𐍆𐍂𐌰𐌸𐌾𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
What did you answer? <br/>
𐍈𐌰 𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌹𐌳𐌴𐍃? <br/>
<hr/>
I love you. <br/>
𐌹𐌺 𐍆𐍂𐌹𐌾𐍉 𐌸𐌿𐌺. <br/>
<hr/>
I love you. <br/>
𐌹𐌺 𐍆𐍂𐌹𐌾𐍉 𐌹𐌲𐌵𐌹𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
Why don't you come visit us? <br/>
𐌳𐌿𐍈𐌴 𐌽𐌹 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌴𐌹𐍃𐍉𐍃 𐌿𐌽𐍃𐌰𐍂𐌰? <br/>
<hr/>
Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous! <br/>
𐌰𐌻𐌻𐌰𐌹 𐍅𐌹𐌻𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌰 𐌲𐌰𐌼𐍉𐍄𐌾𐌰𐌽 𐌸𐌿𐍃. 𐌼𐌴𐍂𐍃 𐌹𐍃! <br/>
<hr/>
Life is hard, but I am harder. <br/>
𐌻𐌹𐌱𐌰𐌹𐌽𐍃 𐌹𐍃𐍄 𐌷𐌰𐍂𐌳𐌿𐍃, 𐌹𐌸 𐌹𐌺 𐌷𐌰𐍂𐌳𐌹𐌶𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
Nothing is beautiful but the truth. <br/>
𐍃𐍉 𐍃𐌿𐌽𐌾𐌰 𐌰𐌹𐌽𐌰 𐌹𐍃𐍄 𐍃𐌺𐌰𐌿𐌽𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
Nobody understands me. <br/>
𐌽𐌹 𐌼𐌰𐌽𐌽𐌰 𐍆𐍂𐌰𐌸𐌾𐌹𐌸 𐌼𐌹𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
Are you referring to me? <br/>
𐍂𐍉𐌳𐌴𐌹𐍃 𐌱𐌹 𐌼𐌹𐌺? <br/>
<hr/>
Would you like something to drink? <br/>
𐍅𐌹𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 𐍈𐌰 𐌳𐌿 𐌳𐍂𐌹𐌲𐌺𐌰𐌽? <br/>
<hr/>
We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools. <br/>
𐍃𐌺𐌿𐌻𐌿𐌼 𐌻𐌰𐌹𐍃𐌾𐌰𐌽 𐌿𐌽𐍃 𐌻𐌹𐌱𐌰𐌽 𐍃𐌰𐌼𐌰𐌽𐌰 𐍃𐍅𐌴 𐌱𐍂𐍉𐌸𐍂𐌾𐌿𐍃, 𐌹𐌱𐌰𐌹 𐌲𐌰𐍃𐍅𐌹𐌻𐍄𐌰𐌹𐌼𐌰 𐍃𐌰𐌼𐌰𐌽𐌰 𐍃𐍅𐌴 𐌳𐍅𐌰𐌻𐌰𐌽𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
"Trust me," he said. <br/>
"𐍄𐍂𐌰𐌿𐌰𐌹 𐌳𐌿 𐌼𐌹𐍃," 𐌵𐌰𐌸 𐌹𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
If you don't eat, you die. <br/>
𐌽𐌹𐌱𐌰 𐌹𐍄𐌰𐌹𐍃, 𐌲𐌰𐍃𐍅𐌹𐌻𐍄𐌹𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
How do you spell "pretty"? <br/>
𐍈𐌰𐌹𐍅𐌰 𐌼𐌴𐌻𐌾𐌰𐌳𐌰 "𐍃𐌺𐌰𐌿𐌽𐍃"? <br/>
<hr/>
You're an angel! <br/>
𐌸𐌿 𐌹𐍃 𐌰𐌲𐌲𐌹𐌻𐌿𐍃! <br/>
<hr/>
I'll take him. <br/>
𐌹𐌺 𐌽𐌹𐌼𐌰 𐌹𐌽𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
That's a good idea! <br/>
𐌸𐌰𐍄𐌰 𐌹𐍃𐍄 𐌲𐍉𐌳𐌰 𐌼𐌹𐍄𐍉𐌽𐍃! <br/>
<hr/>
They say love is blind. <br/>
𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌰𐌳𐌰 𐌸𐌰𐍄𐌴𐌹 𐍆𐍂𐌹𐌾𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌸𐌰 𐍃𐌹𐌾𐌰𐌹 𐌱𐌻𐌹𐌽𐌳𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
You'll forget about me someday. <br/>
𐌿𐍆𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌿𐌽𐌽𐍉𐍃 𐌼𐌹𐍃 𐍃𐌿𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌼𐌰 𐌳𐌰𐌲𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
Do whatever he tells you. <br/>
𐍄𐌰𐍅𐌴𐌹 𐍈𐌰 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌰𐌹 𐌸𐌿𐍃. <br/>
<hr/>
What do you want? <br/>
𐍈𐌰 𐍅𐌹𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃? <br/>
<hr/>
I have a dream. <br/>
𐌹𐌺 𐌷𐌰𐌱𐌰 𐌳𐍂𐌰𐌿𐌼. <br/>
<hr/>
You found me where no one else was looking. <br/>
𐌸𐌿 𐌱𐌹𐌲𐌰𐍃𐍄 𐌼𐌹𐌺 𐌸𐌰𐍂𐌴𐌹 𐌽𐌹 𐌼𐌰𐌽𐌽𐌰 𐍃𐍉𐌺𐌹𐌳𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
I like it very much. <br/>
𐌲𐌰𐌻𐌴𐌹𐌺𐌰𐌹𐌸 𐌼𐌹𐍃 𐍆𐌹𐌻𐌿. <br/>
<hr/>
These things aren't mine! <br/>
𐌸𐍉 𐌽𐌹 𐍃𐌹𐌽𐌳 𐌼𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌰! <br/>
<hr/>
Would you like to dance with me? <br/>
𐍅𐌹𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 𐍀𐌻𐌹𐌽𐍃𐌾𐌰𐌽 𐌼𐌹𐌸 𐌼𐌹𐍃? <br/>
<hr/>
Nobody came. <br/>
𐌽𐌹 𐌼𐌰𐌽𐌽𐌰 𐌵𐌰𐌼. <br/>
<hr/>
Look at me when I talk to you! <br/>
𐌰𐍄𐍃𐌰𐌹𐍈 𐌼𐌹𐌺 𐌱𐌹𐌸𐌴 𐍂𐍉𐌳𐌾𐌰 𐌳𐌿 𐌸𐌿𐍃! <br/>
<hr/>
What would the world be without women? <br/>
𐍈𐌰 𐍃𐌹𐌾𐌰𐌹 𐍃𐌰 𐌼𐌹𐌳𐌾𐌿𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐍃 𐌹𐌽𐌿𐌷 𐌵𐌹𐌽𐍉𐌽𐍃? <br/>
<hr/>
You don't know who I am. <br/>
𐌽𐌹 𐍅𐌰𐌹𐍃𐍄 𐍈𐌰𐍃 𐌹𐌼. <br/>
<hr/>
The wind calmed down. <br/>
𐍃𐌰 𐍅𐌹𐌽𐌳𐍃 𐌰𐌽𐌰𐍃𐌻𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌹𐌳𐌰. <br/>
<hr/>
Who searches, finds. <br/>
𐍃𐌰𐌴𐌹 𐍃𐍉𐌺𐌴𐌹𐌸, 𐌱𐌹𐌲𐌹𐍄𐌹𐌸. <br/>
<hr/>
We have a Pope. <br/>
𐍀𐌰𐍀𐌰𐌼 𐌷𐌰𐌱𐌰𐌼. <br/>
<hr/>
I don't think, therefore I am not. <br/>
𐌽𐌹 𐌸𐌰𐌲𐌺𐌾𐌰, 𐌴𐌹𐌸𐌰𐌽 𐌽𐌹 𐌹𐌼. <br/>
<hr/>
Take a book and read it. <br/>
𐌽𐌹𐌼 𐌱𐍉𐌺𐍉𐍃 𐌾𐌰𐌷 𐌿𐍃𐍃𐌹𐌲𐌲 𐌸𐍉𐍃. <br/>

He's already a man. <br/>
