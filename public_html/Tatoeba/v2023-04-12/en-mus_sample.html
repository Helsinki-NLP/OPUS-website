Since I'm a Florida Indian, I don't have a "tribal town" per se, but I am bird clan. <br/>

At that time the United States, North and South, were engaged in war, and when the war was coming into Indian Territory, the Indians divided. <br/>
Momof Wvcenv Kvsappv, Lekothv horre etenhayē em oketvn mv horre este-catvke em ēkvnvn yohcēyvranof, este-catvke tekvpakvtēs. <br/>
<hr/>
Some men became soldiers for the North, and some became soldiers for the South. <br/>
Honvntake vpvlwvt Kvsappv ensuletawv haken, vpvlwvt Lekothv ensuletawv haket omvtēs. <br/>
<hr/>
Of the old men, women, elderly women, and small children, some went to the North, and some went to the South, leaving many things in their homes, and leaving their livestock too, they ran. <br/>
Este-honvntake vculakat, hoktvke, hoktvlvke, hopuetakuce esyomat vpvlwvt Kvsvppof fvccvn vpēyen, vpvlwvt Lekothof fvccvn vpēyen cuko nake vtēhkat sulkēn wiket, em vpuekvo wikahket pefatket omvtēs. <br/>
<hr/>
My mother’s eldest brother became a soldier for the South. <br/>
Cvpvwv ’svculat Lekothv ensuletawv hakvtēs. <br/>
<hr/>
During the war they took me toward the South, leaving some of their belongings behind. <br/>
Horrē emoketvn Lekothof fvccvn ’svcvpēhoyvtēs, em enak-ockv vpvlwv wihket. <br/>
<hr/>
Many people traveled together, [but] many people stopped and camped, and my late grandmother, taking one of her sons with her, returned and got the cattle. <br/>
Este sulkē tohkvlkēt vpēyen, este sulkat fekhoniyet vpoken, cvpuse tatēt echuswv cēpvnē hvmken ēyvpvyēt rasfuliket wakvn yesfulkvtēt omēs. <br/>
<hr/>
It was during the frightening time of war, so thinking there might be Northern soldiers in the area, my father and two other men were appointed to scout around. <br/>
Momen horre ofv penkvlkē em oketvt onkv, Kvsappv suletawv estvn vpoket monkat fullēpis ohmēs komat, cvrken honvntake ētv hokkolet vpaken vketēckvn vtothoyvtēs. <br/>
<hr/>
Leaving the main camp, they went far off. <br/>
Estehvpo-rakko enkvpahket hopvyēn vpēyet fullvtēs. <br/>
<hr/>
I don’t know the land where my father died, but it might be Choctaw country. <br/>
Ēkvnv estvmvn cvrke ēlet omvtē kerrvkot os, momîs Cahtv ēkvnvt omē witvtēs. <br/>
<hr/>
My father died before I knew him. <br/>

<hr/>
We used to live in houses made of logs, ugly little houses. <br/>

<hr/>
At that time we were suffering. <br/>
Momen mv oketv este estemerkvkēt fullet omēyvntvs. <br/>
<hr/>
At that time, Indians were not to eat rabbit meat, they said, <br/>
Mv omof, este-cate tat cufe vpeswv pvpetv tokot omēs makakēt onkv, <br/>
<hr/>
Now rabbit skins were being bought, and young men and even older men hunted rabbits and, after killing them, took the skins and threw away the meat. <br/>
Monkv cufe-comottv ehvrpen neshoyēt omvcoken, cēpvnvke este vculvkē stomis cufe hopoyet pvsatat hvrpen encawet em vpeswv tat vpvlvthoyvntvs. <br/>
<hr/>
For a little over four years, there was no food, there were no clothes and boys about the age of seventeen and under went around naked. <br/>
Ohrolopē ostat senhoyvnusēn, hompetv sekon, accvkē tateu sekon, cēpvnvke em vculkv ohrolopē palē kolvpohkakat mahē em elecv ayat enatv̜ lkakuset fulleyvntvs. <br/>
<hr/>
After the war became peace, we returned to our lands and lived along the edge of the Canadian [River], but we were still without food, without clothes for about three years. <br/>
Momen mv horre herkv hahkof, pum ēkvnv raohfolēcēt eryiceyat Kvnēte vfopken vpoket omēyîs, hompetv seko accvkē sekat emonken, ohrolopē toccēnat mahe orvtēs. <br/>
