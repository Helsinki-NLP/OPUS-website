(trg)="1"> JISHIMIKILA JA BWIKALO <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="3"> Byashimikizha ba Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="4"> Najingatu na myaka ibiji mu 1975 kimye kitanshi bamama kyo bamwene’mba nji na lukatazho . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="5"> Bamama byo bandelele , balunda nabo bataile kintu panshi kyavumine bingi ne kuba kyongo kikatampe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="6"> Bamama bamwene kuba’mba kechi nabazhimukile ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="7"> Nafikizhe myaka isatu , kwa kubula kuyuka kwamba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="8"> Bansemi kibapezhezhe bingi maana dokotala byo ebabujile’mba ne kibulu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="9"> Saka nkijitu mwanyike , bansemi bami masongola apwile , Bamama bajinga na mwingilo wa kulama amiwa ne bakolojami babakazhi ne babalume bunke . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="10"> Pa kyokya kimye , mu France babibulu kechi bafunjile byonka byo bafunda luno ne , kabiji mashinda o baingijishanga alengelanga buyanji kubayilako . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="11"> Nangwa byonkabyo , kufumatu ku bwanyike bwami najinga na mashuko abujile babibulu bavula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(trg)="12"> Lekai nshimikizhe byo kyajinga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="13"> Pa myaka yavula , bafunjishi bavula baitabijile kuba’mba baana ba bibulu bafwainwa kufunda kupichila mu kutala pa kanwa ne kumona bibena kuvwevweta byatunwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="14"> Mu France , monakomejile , mulaka wa kwamba na maboko bamukainye mu masukulu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="15"> Baana ba bibulu bavula be bakasanga maboko kunyuma kimye kyo babena kufunda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="16"> Byo nakijingatu mwanyike , naikalanga kimye kyabaya na dokotala ufunjisha bya kwamba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="17"> Wankwatanga ku mubanga nangwa ku mutwe ne kundengela kubwezhabwezhapo byambo byo nabulanga kumvwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="18"> Kechi nesambanga na banyike bakwetu ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="19"> Ano moba ajinga a buyanji bingi kwi amiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="20"> Byo nafikizhe myaka itanu na umo , bantumine ku sukulu wa ba bibulu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="21"> Kyo kyajinga kimye kitanshi kyo nesambilepo na ba bibulu bakwetu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="22"> Kuno nako kechi baswishanga kwamba na maboko ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="23"> Inge waingijishatu maboko pa kwamba mu sukulu , ko kuba’mba basa kukukokola nangwa ku kukoka nsuki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="24"> Nangwa byonkabyo , kwa bunke twisambanga na maboko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="25"> Kyapeleleko , natendekele kwisamba na bakwetu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="26"> Po patendekejile myaka ina ya lusekelo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="27"> Nangwa byonkabyo , byo nafikizhe myaka jikumi , bantwajile pa sukulu pajinga baana bamba ne kumvwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="28"> Kino kyanshinkile bingi bulaka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="29"> Nalangulukilenga namba baana ba babibulu bonse bafwa pano yami yenka nashalapo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="30"> Byo balondejile muzhilo wa kwa dokotala , wachinanga’mba kwandapo kyapwilamotu kwa kubula kwamba , ba mu kisemi kyami kechi bayukile kwamba na maboko ne kabiji kechi banswishanga kukaya na baana ba babibulu ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="31"> Mbena kuvuluka kimye kyo twafwakashijile dokotala , watujile buku wa mu mulaka wa kwamba na maboko pa desiki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="32"> Byo namwene bipikichala pa nkupiko , natongweleko munwe ne kwamba namba , “ Mbena kukeba yewo buku . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="33"> Bukiji bukiji dokotala wamufile buku . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="34"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="35"> NATENDEKA KUFUNDA BUKINE <br>
(trg)="36"> Bamama betufunjishe mafunde a bwina Kilishitu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="37"> Betusendanga ku kipwilo kya Mérignac kya Bakamonyi ba kwa Yehoba , ku bwipi na Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="38"> Byo nakijinga mwanyike , kechi naumvwanga byaambiwanga pa kupwila ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="39"> Nangwa byonkabyo , bavula bebikangako bingi kunembela bishinka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="40"> Butemwe ne kunta muchima kwabo kwamfikile bingi pa muchima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="41"> Pa nzubo , bamama bamfunjishanga Baibolo , pano bino kechi naumvwanga byo bamfunjishanga ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> Naumvwine byonka biumvwine ngauzhi Danyela , awo panyuma ya kutambwila bungauzhi waambile’mba : “ ne byumvwinetu , bino kechi nebyumvwine mo byayila ne . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> Kwi amiwa kyajinga’mba “ Namwene , bino kechi ne byumvwine mo byayila ne . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="44"> Nangwa byonkabyo , bukine bwa mu Baibolo bwatendekele kujimba mizhazhi mwi amiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="45"> Nanemekele byo naumvwanga kabiji ne bikangako kwibingijisha mu bwikalo bwami . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="46"> Kabiji nafunjilanga ne ku byubilo bya bakwetu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="47"> Kyakumwenako , Baibolo witutundaika kwikala batekanya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="48"> Kechi nayukile kutekanya byo kulumbulula ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="49"> Pano bino , kupichila mu kumona bena Kilishitu bakwetu byo bamweshanga kino kyubilo , naishile kuyuka kutekanya byo kulumbulula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="50"> Kwambatu kine , namwenamo bingi mu kupwila kwa bwina Kilishitu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="51"> KULEFULWA NE BYAWAMA BYAFUMAMO <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="52"> Juba jimo , saka nkyangye kufikizha myaka 20 , namwene babibulu bakyanyike saka besamba mu mulaka wa kwamba na maboko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="53"> Natendekele kukaya nabo mu bufyamfya kabiji natendekele kufunda Mulaka wa Kwamba na Maboko wa ki French . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="54"> Natwajijile kutanwa ku kupwila kwa bwina Kilishitu , konataine Kamonyi wa kyanyike wantemenwe bingi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="55"> Wibikangako bingi kwisamba ne amiwa kabiji bulunda bwetu bwakosele . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="56"> Nangwa byonkabyo , kwamwekele kintu kyankolele bingi ku muchima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="57"> Stéphane bamutaile pa kazhima na mambo a kukana kwimvwanga mu nkondo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="58"> Kino kyampezhezhe bingi maana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="59"> Stéphane byo ajinga mu kaleya , kyandefwile kya kuba kwashajiletu pacheche kuleka kutanwa ku kupwila kwa bwina Kilishitu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="60"> Byo papichile bañondo 11 , Stéphane bamufumishe mu kaleya kabiji wabwelele ku nzubo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="61"> Fwanyikizhai byo kyankumishe Stéphane byo atendekele kwisamba ne amiwa mu mulaka wa kwamba na maboko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="62"> Kechi ne kiswile ne ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="63"> Ki ka kyamwekele ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="64"> Stéphane wafunjile Mulaka wa Kwamba na Maboko wa ki French mu kaleya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="65"> Inge namona Stéphane byo abena kwingijisha maboko ne mubiji , naumvwanga bingi bulongo . <br>
(trg)="66"> PANO NAUMVWISHA BUKINE BWA MU BAIBOLO <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="67"> Stéphane watendekele kumfunjisha Baibolo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="68"> Kufumatu kyo kya kimye natendekele kukwatankanya bukine bonse bo nafunjile . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="69"> Byo nakijinga lukeke , natemenwe bingi kutamba bipikichala biji mu mabuku etu , kwesakanya baji mu bipikichala ne kukeba bishinka byonse pa kubatu’mba ñumvwishe jishimikila . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="70"> Nayukile pe Abalahama “ lukunwa , ” ne “ jibumba jikatampe , ” bino byo bandondolwejile mu mulaka wa kwamba na maboko popo nayukile mo byatala . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="71"> Kyamwekeshetu patoka kuba’mba pano po natana mulaka mwine , mulaka wa kyami kyami . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="72"> Byo natendekele kumvwa byonse byaambiwenga pa kupwila , muchima wakasulukile kabiji nakebelenga kufunjilapo byavula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="73"> Na mambo a kuba Stéphane wankwashanga , nayukile byavula bya mu Baibolo , kabiji mu 1992 nepaine kwi Yehoba Lesa ne kubatizhiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="74"> Nangwa kya kuba nayukile byavula , nakijinga na bumvu kabiji kyankatazhanga bingi kwisamba na bantu mambo ku bwanyike kechi nesambanga na bantu ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="75"> KWIBIKAKO KUPWISHA BUMVU <br>
(trg)="76"> Mu kuya kwa moba , kajibumba ka babibulu ko najingamo bekavwangile na kipwilo kya mu Pessac , kyajinga mu Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="77"> Kino kyankwashishe bingi kabiji kyandengejile kuyilako palutwe mu bukine . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="78"> Nangwa byonkabyo , nakijinga na lukatazho lwa kwisamba na bantu , balunda nami babujile bibulu batangako bingi muchima ne kumona kuba’mba naumvwa byonse . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="79"> Bamulume ne mukazhi bamo , ba Gilles ne ba Elodie , bebikangako bingi kwisamba na amiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="80"> Javula bansendanga ku nzubo kwabo inge twafuma na kupwila , bajinga balunda bawama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="81"> Byo kiletapo lusekelo kwikala pa bantu balondela mashinda a kwa Lesa ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="82"> Mu kino kipwilo mo nataine Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="83"> Natemenwe byo ajinga na lusa ne kuyuka mwakubila na bintu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="84"> Kechi wamonanga’mba bukibulu bulengela kukankalwa kwisamba ne , wibumona’mba jishinda ja kufunjilamo kwisamba na bibulu . <br>

(trg)="85"> Wankubwile bingi muchima , kabiji mu 2005 twisongwele . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="86"> Nangwa kinkatazha kwisamba bulongo , Vanessa wankwasha kupwisha bumvu ne kwisamba saka na kasuluka . <br>
