(src)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
(trg)="1"> ULANDU WOMUENYO <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> Ulandu wa Lomboluiwa la Manji Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="3"> Kunyamo wo 1975 eci nda kuata anyamo avali , oco mãi a limbuka okuti ndi kuete ocitangi cimue . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="4"> Osimbu mãi a kala oku ndi kuata vokuokuo , ekamba liange lia kupuila posi ocina cimue ca linga onjuela yalua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="5"> Mãi wa limbuka okuti sia yevele onjuela yaco . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="6"> Eci nda tẽlisa anyamo atatu , sia telẽle oku vangula ciwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Epata liange lia sumuile calua eci ndotolo a va sapuila okuti ndicisitatũi ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="8"> Olonjali viange via litepa eci nda kala omõla , kuenje ame la va huvange vatatu , kumue la Mãi , tua ilukila kocitumãlo cikuavo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="9"> Kotembo yaco omãla ovisitatũi kofeka yo Fransa ka va endele oku longisiwa ciwa kolosikola , ndeci ca siata koloneke vilo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="10"> Momo va enda oku talisa ohali ovisitatũi . <br>
(trg)="11"> Pole , eci nda kala omõla nda kuata esumũlũho limue okuti , ovisitatũi vikuavo ci sule . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="12"> Cilo ndi lombolola ulandu wange . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="13"> Vokuenda kuotembo alongisi valua va limbuka okuti , omãla ovisitatũi va pondola oku vangula lekuatiso liomakina yi tanga oku lisengasenga kuomẽla . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="14"> Kofeka yo Fransa nda kulila , ka va tavele okuti omanu va vangula elimi lioku ilaika kosikola . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="15"> Omãla vamue ovisitatũi va enda oku va kutila ovoko konyima osimbu va lilongisa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="16"> Vokuenda kuanyamo amue , nda enda oku kala olowola vialua vosemana londotolo yi kuatisa vana va kuete ocitangi coku vangula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="17"> Nda enda oku votola utue kuenda oku kisikiwa oku pitulula olonjanja vialua olondaka vimue okuti si vi yevite . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="18"> Sia tẽlele oku sapela lomãla vakuavo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="19"> Vokuenda kuotembo yaco nda tala ohali yalua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="20"> Eci nda tẽlisa anyamo epandu , nda tumĩwa kosikola ku tangela omãla ovisitatũi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="21"> Kosikola yaco nda lisanga lomãla vakuavo ovisitatũi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="22"> Pole , vahandelekele okuti , ka ci tava oku vangula elimi lioku ilaika . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="23"> Nda umue wa seteka oku ci linga , o kangisiwa , ale o nãliwa vesinga liaye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="24"> Omo liaco , tua enda oku sapela vuyombeki poku kuama olondimbukiso vimue tua luvikiya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="25"> Ovina viaco , via ndi kuatisa oku sapela lomãla vakuavo , kuenje nda kuata esanju vokuenda kuanyamo akuãla . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="26"> Eci nda tẽlisa ekũi lianyamo , nda tumiwa kosikola ku tangela omãla va yevite . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="27"> Nda sumuile calua , kuenda ca kala ndu okuti , omãla vosi ovisitatũi va fa , ame lika nda supapo voluali ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="28"> Nda kuama olonumbi via ndotolo , vi lekisa eci ndi sukila oku linga oco ndi kuatisiwe lesaku nda tambula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="29"> Pole , epata liange ka lia lilongisile elimi lioku ilaika kuenda ka ca tavele vali okuti ndi linga ukamba lomãla ovisitatũi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="31"> Eci nda mola elitalatu lia kala koñoño yelivulu liaco , nda ilika loku popia hati , “ ndi yongola elivulu ndeli ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="32"> Ndotolo wa soleka lonjanga elivulu liaco . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="33"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="34"> Mãi wa seteka oku tu longisa olonumbi Viembimbiliya tunde vutila . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="35"> Eye wa enda oku tu ambata kolohongele via enda oku lingiwila ko Mérignac , ocipepi lo Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="36"> Omo okuti nda kala omõla , ka ca lelukile oku kuata elomboloko liovina via enda oku popiwa kolohongele . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="37"> Pole , vamanji vamue va enda oku tumãla ponele yange loku ndi sonehẽla ovina vi popiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="38"> Nda vetiyiwa calua locisola cavo kuenda ndomo va ndi tata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="39"> Konjo Mãi wa enda oku ndi longisa Embimbiliya pole , ka ca lelukile oku kapako ovina a enda oku ndi longisa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="40"> Vepulivi liaco nda kala Nduprofeto Daniele okuti , noke yoku tambula ocitumasuku ca eciwa lungelo wa popia hati : ‘ Nda ci yeva , pole ka ca ndombolokele . ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> ( Daniele 12 : 8 ) Kokuange ca kala ndoco : “ Nda ci mõla , pole ka ca ndombolokele . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="42"> Vokuenda kuotembo nda fetika oku kuata elomboloko liocili Cembimbiliya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="43"> Nda sanjukila calua elomboloko nda kala oku kuata loku kapako ovina nda kala oku lilongisa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="44"> Nda lilongisilavo kovituwa viwa viavakuetu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="45"> Embimbiliya li tu vetiya oku kala vakuepandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="46"> Pole , sia kũlĩhĩle eci ci lomboloka oku kala ukuepandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="47"> Poku mõla ndomo vakuetu va lekisa ocituwa caco , nda fetika oku kũlĩha eci ci lomboloka oku kala ukuepandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="48"> Ocili okuti , vamanji vekongelo va ndi kuatisa calua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="49"> Eteke limue eci nda kala lanyamo ekũi , nda sanga vonjila amalẽhe vamue ovisitatũi va kala oku sapela velimi lioku ilaika . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="50"> Nda linga ukamba lavo vuyombeki kuenje nda fetika oku lilongisa elimi lioku ilaika liofeka yo Fransa ( FSL ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="51"> Nda amamako oku endaenda kolohongele kuenje nda linga ukamba lumalẽhe umue Ombangi ya Yehova o tukuiwa hati , Stéphane . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="52"> Eye wa enda oku likolisilako calua oco a sapele lame kuenda ukamba wange laye wa livokiya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="53"> Pole , nda kala oku lavoka esumuo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="54"> Omo okuti manji Stéphane wa likala oku enda ku sualali , vo kapa vokayike . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="55"> Kuenje , ca ndi sumũisa calua ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="56"> Osimbu manji Stéphane a kala vokayike , ombili yange ya fetika oku tepuluka , kuenje nda liwekapo oku endaenda kolohongele . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="57"> Eci pa pita ekũi liolosãi losãi yimosi , manji Stéphane vo weca kuenje wa tiuka konjo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="58"> Nda kuata esanju lialua eci manji Stéphane a fetika oku sapela lame velimi lioku ilaika . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="59"> Sia tavele kovina nda kala oku mõla ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="60"> Kuenje nda lipula ndoco : Nye ca pita laye ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="61"> Vokayike , manji Stéphane wa lilongisa elimi lioku ilaika liofeka yo Fransa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="62"> Nda kala oku vanja ndomo manji Stéphane a linga olondimbukiso poku nyanyomõla ovaka , kuenda ndomo ocipala caye ca kala , kuenje ovina viaco via vokiya elomboloko liange . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="63"> Manji Stéphane wa fetika oku ndi longisa Embimbiliya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="64"> Noke kavali ketu , tua fetika oku kundila kumosi pocitumãlo cimue oco tu longise Embimbiliya komanu tu sanga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="65"> Nda solele calua oku tala alitalatu a posoka a sangiwa valivulu etu loku sokisa ovituwa vi lekisiwa valitalatu kuenda oku kũlĩhĩsa atosi akuavo oco a ndi kuatise . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="66"> Nda kũlĩhĩle ulandu wa Avirahama , “ ocitumbulukila caye , ” kuenda “ owiñi wakahandangala , ” pole , ovina viaco , ovio lika nda kũlĩhĩle ciwa loku vi lombolola velimi lioku ilaika . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="67"> ( Efetikilo 22 : 15 - 18 ; Esituluilo 7 : 9 ) Omo liaco , nda sanga elimi liange okuti , li ndi kuatisa oku sanga elomboloko liovina . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="68"> Omo okuti nda fetika oku kuata elomboloko liovina vi vanguiwa kolohongele , ca vetiya utima wange , kuenje onjongole yange yoku amamako oku lilongisa ya livokiya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="69"> Lekuatiso lia manji Stéphane elomboloko liange Liembimbiliya lia livokiya , kuenje kunyamo wo 1992 nda litumbika ku Yehova Suku kuenda nda papatisiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="70"> Ndaño nda kala oku amamako oku pamisa ekolelo liange , pole ka ca lelukile oku sapela lomanu , momo tunde vutila sia kuatele ocituwa coku sapela lomãla vakuavo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="71"> Omo okuti ocimunga covisitatũi ca kala citito , nda sapela la vamanji va kasi vekongelo ko Pessac , vocikanjo ci kasi ko Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="72"> Lekuatiso lia vamanji , nda amamako oku pamisa ekolelo liange . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="73"> Ndaño nda kuata ocitangi coku vangula , pole akamba vange okuti havisitatũiko va enda oku linga ovina lonjila yimue okuti ndi kuata elomboloko liovina viosi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="74"> Manji Gilles kumue lukãi waye Elodie , va enda oku likolisilako oku sapela lame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="75"> Ovo va enda oku ndi laleka oco tulie ale oku yuvila o kafe noke yohongele , kuenje ca pamisa ukamba wetu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(trg)="76"> Hesanjukuolio ndi kuete omo lioku kala lomanu va pokola kolonumbi via Suku ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="77"> Vekongelo nda kala nda kũlĩha manji umue ufeko wa posoka calua o tukuiwa hati , Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="78"> Ovituwa viaye viwa kuenda esunguluko liaye via ndi vetiya oku u sola . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="79"> Eye ka ecelele okuti ocitangi cange coku kala ocisitatũi cu tateka oku sapela lame , pole , co kuatisa oku lilongisa oku sapela lovisitatũi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
(trg)="80"> Ndo sola calua , kuenje tua kuela kunyamo wo 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="81"> Ndaño okuti sia lianjele poku sapela lomanu , pole , Vanessa wa ndi kuatisa oku yula ocitangi cange cosõi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
(trg)="82"> Nda sanjukila calua ekuatiso liaye , osimbu ndi tẽlisa ovikele viange . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
(trg)="83"> Noke yolohuela vietu , vamanji kofiliale Yolombangi Via Yehova yo ko Fransa kolupale luo Louviers , va ndi laleka oco ndi tambula epindiso vokuenda kuosãi , liatiamẽla kupange woku pongolola alivulu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> In recent years the branch has been working very hard to produce several publications in FSL on DVD . <br>
(trg)="84"> Kanyamo a pita o filiale ya linga esokiyo liokuti ku pangiwa alivulu kelimi lioku ilaika lio Fransa vo DVD . <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>
(src)="90"> Giving a Bible talk in French Sign Language <br>
(trg)="85"> Pole , omo liupange walua ocimunga coku pongolola ca sukilile oku vokiya etendelo lia vamanji . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
(trg)="86"> Ame kumue lukãi wange Vanessa , tua kũlĩhĩle okuti oku talavaya ko Betele esumũlũho limue linene , kuenda ombanjaile ya tunda ku Yehova Suku , pole ca tu nenela esakalalo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> What would happen to our sign - language group ? <br>
(trg)="87"> Kuenje , tua lipula ndoco : Ocimunga cetu celimi lioku ilaika ci kala ndati ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> What would we do with our house ? <br>
(trg)="88"> Onjo yetu hẽ yi kala ndati ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> Would Vanessa find work in the region ? <br>
(trg)="89"> Vanessa o ka sanga hẽ upange ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
(trg)="90"> Pole Yehova wa tu kuatisa oku tetulula ovitangi viaco . <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>
(trg)="91"> Kuenje , nda limbuka ocisola Yehova a tu kuetele kuenda omanu ovisitatũi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="97"> Having been involved in translation work , I can better understand all that is done to provide spiritual help for the deaf . <br>
(trg)="92"> Omo lioku litumbika kupange woku pongolola ndi pondola oku kuata elomboloko lia suapo liovina vi kasi oku lingiwa oco tu kuatise ovisitatũi oku kũlĩha Yehova . <br>
<hr>
(src)="98"> And what a pleasure to see many fellow workers try to communicate with me ! <br>
(trg)="93"> Nda kuata esanju lialua poku mola ndomo vamanji tu talavaya lavo va kala oku seteka oku vangula lame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="99"> The few signs that they learn and try to use touch my heart . <br>
(trg)="94"> Ovo va kuama olondimbukiso va lilongisa oco va vetiye utima wange . <br>
<hr>
(src)="100"> I do not feel left out ​ — far from it . <br>
(trg)="95"> Nda lianjele oku kala pokati kavo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="101"> All those expressions of love are a demonstration of the extraordinary unity among Jehovah’s people . ​ — Psalm 133 : 1 . <br>
(trg)="96"> Ocisola vamanji va lekisa , ca kala ocindekaise celitokeko li kasi pokati kafendeli va Yehova . — Osamo 133 : 1 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="103"> I am grateful to Jehovah that through the Christian congregation , he has always made sure that someone was there to help me . <br>
(trg)="97"> Ndi pandula Yehova omo okuti olonjanja viosi wa vetiya vamanji vekongelo oco va ndi kuatise . <br>
<hr>
(src)="104"> I also appreciate the small role I have had in helping my fellow deaf ones to know our loving Creator and to draw close to him . <br>
(trg)="98"> Nda sanjukilavo ocikele ndi kuete coku kuatisa vakuetu ovisitatũi oku kũlĩha Ululiki wetu ukuacisola kuenda oku kuata ukamba laye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="105"> I look forward to the day when all communication barriers will be removed and all will speak the “ pure language ” ​ — the truth about Jehovah God and his purposes — ​ as part of a united human family . ​ — Zephaniah 3 : 9 . <br>
(trg)="99"> Ndi lavoka lesanju otembo eci vosi tu ka vangula ‘ upopi wa pua esanda ’ okuti , u lomboloka ocili catiamẽla ku Yehova Suku , una o yongola oku tokekisa epata liosi liomanu . — Sofoniya 3 : 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="106"> It was not until 1991 that the French government officially authorized the use of sign language in educating deaf children . <br>
(trg)="100"> Kunyamo wo 1991 oco lika ombiali yofeka yo Fransa ya tava okuti omãla ovisitatũi va longisiwa lekuatiso lielimi lioku ilaika . <br>
