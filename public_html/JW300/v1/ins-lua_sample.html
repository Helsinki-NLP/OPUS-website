(src)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
(trg)="1"> MALU A MU NSOMBELU <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="3"> Muyuki mulonda kudi Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="4"> Pamvua ne bidimu bibidi mu 1975 , ke musangu wa kumpala uvua maman wanyi mumone ne : mvua ne disama kampanda mu mubidi wanyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="5"> Pavua maman mungambule mu maboko ende , mulunda wende mukuabu wakakulula tshintu kampanda tshia bujitu panshi kuenzatshi mutoyi mukole . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="6"> Ke maman kumona ne : tshivua nansha mukatamuke to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="7"> Pamvua ne bidimu bisatu , tshivua ngakula to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="8"> Munganga wakambila baledi banyi bualu buvua bubasame ku muoyo bikole ne : mvua kamama ne tshivua ngumvua ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="9"> Pantshivua muana , baledi banyi bakabenganana kushipabu dibaka , nunku maman wakatukolesha meme ne bana betu babidi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="10"> Mu tshikondo atshi , bana bavua tumama mu ditunga dia France kabavua balonga tulasa bu mudibi bienzeka lelu to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="12"> Kadi katshia ku buana buanyi mvua ne diakalenga divua tumama tua bungi katuyi nadi to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="13"> Lekelayi nnumvuije . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="14"> Imue misangu , balongeshi ba bungi bavua bela meji ne : kudi mushindu wa kulongesha bana badi tumama mua kuakula ne kumvua padibu batangila mudi mishiku ya balongeshi inyunga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="15"> Bushuwa , mu ditunga dia France mumvua mukolele , mbulamatadi uvua mukandike bua kulongesha bana muakulu wa tumama mu tulasa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="16"> Bavua basuika maboko a tumue tumama pa nyima mu tshikondo tshivuabu batulongesha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="17"> Mu bidimu bianyi bia ntuadijilu , mvua mpitshisha mêba a bungi lumingu luonso ne munganga wa malu a tumama uvua undongesha mua kuakula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="18"> Bavua bankuata ku tshibanga anyi ku mutu ne bangenzeja bua mpatule dîyi dimvua tshiyi nansha ngumvua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="19"> Bivua binkolele bua kuyukila ne bana bakuabu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="20"> Bivua bidimu bia lutatu buanyi meme . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="21"> Pashishe , pangakapeta bidimu bisambombo , bakantuma mu tulasa tua tumama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="22"> Ke musangu wa kumpala uvua mutuilangane ne tumama tukuabu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="23"> Mu tulasa atu bavua kabidi bakandike muakulu wa tumama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="24"> Pavua muntu uteta bua kuyukila mu muakulu wa tumama mu kalasa , bavua bamukuma pa minu anyi bamukoka nsuki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="25"> Kadi tuvua tuakula mu musokoko ne jeste ya mu tuetu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="26"> Ndekelu wa bionso , ngakamanya mua kuyukila ne bana bakuabu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="27"> Ke mua katuadija bidimu bianyi binayi bia disanka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="28"> Pamvua ne bidimu dikumi , mvua mu tulasa tupuekele ne bana bavua bumvua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="29"> Bavua banseka ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="30"> Mvua ngela meji ne : tumama tukuabu tuvua tufue ne mvua mushale nkayanyi pa buloba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="31"> Bu muvua bena mu dîku dietu batumikila mibelu ivua baminganga bavua bamanye malu a tumama babambila , ne bu muvuabu ne buôwa bua ne : tshilu kupanga kuakula , bakabenga kulonga muakulu wa tumama ne kabavua bitaba bua meme kudisangisha ne tumama tukuabu to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="32"> Ndi mvuluka dituku dikuabu dituvua baye kutangila mumanga wa matshi , uvua ne mukanda wa muakulu wa tumama muteka pa mêsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> Pangakamona foto ivua pa tshizubu tshia mukanda , ngakamuleja ne munu , ne kumuambila ne : “ Ndi musue mukanda eu ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="34"> Munganga kusokokaye diakamue mukanda au . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="35"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="37"> Maman uvua uditatshisha bua kutulongesha mua kutumikila mikenji ya mu Bible . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="38"> Uvua uya netu mu bisangilu bia Bantemu ba Yehowa bivuabu benza mu Mérignac pabuipi ne Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="39"> Bu muntshivua muana , mvua ngumvua anu malu makese mu bisangilu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="40"> Kadi bena mu tshisumbu bavua balua kusomba ku luseke luanyi , bamfundila malu a bivuabu balongesha mu bisangilu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="41"> Dinanga diabu ne mushindu uvuabu baditatshisha bua bualu buanyi biakandenga bikole . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="42"> Ku nzubu , maman uvua ulonga nanyi Bible , kadi tshivua nkuata bimpe bivuaye undongesha to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> Mvua ndiumvua anu bu muprofete Danyele pavuaye mupete mêyi a buprofete kudi muanjelu , wakamba ne : ‘ Ngakumvua mêyi aa , kadi tshiakaajingulula nansha . ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="44"> Kadi buanyi meme , lutatu luvua ne : “ Mvua mmona , kadi tshivua ngumvua . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="45"> Ku kakese ku kakese , malu malelela akatuadija kubuela mu muoyo wanyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="46"> Ngakatuadija kunanga malu amvua ngumvua ne kuatumikila mu nsombelu wanyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="47"> Ngikadilu mimpe ya bantu bakuabu ivua kabidi indongesha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="48"> Tshilejilu , Bible udi utuambila bua kuikala ne lutulu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="49"> Tshivua ngumvua bimpe tshivua kuikala ne lutulu kusua kumvuija to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="50"> Kadi , pamvua ntangila muvua bena Kristo bakuabu baleja ngikadilu eu , mvua mufike ku diumvua tshidi lutulu lumvuija . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="51"> Bulelela , tshisumbu tshia bena Kristo tshivua tshingambuluishe bikole . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="52"> DIBUNGAMA PASHISHE DISANKA DIA BUNGI <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="53"> Dikuabu dituku pamvua ne bidimu dikumi ne bia mu njila , ngakamona tumama tukuabu tuyukila mu muakulu wa tumama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="54"> Ngakatuadija kudisangisha natu mumusokoko ne meme kutuadija kulonga muakulu wa tumama wa bena France . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="55"> Ngakatungunuka ne kubuela mu bisangilu bia bena Kristo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="56"> Meme kumonamu Stéphane Ntemu mukuabu utshivua nsonga uvua uditatshisha bua bualu buanyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="57"> Uvua wenza muende muonso bua kuyukila nanyi , ne meme kudia nende bulunda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="58"> Kadi bia dibungama , bakela Stéphane mu buloko bualu kavua musue kuenza mudimu wa busalayi to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="59"> Biakansama ku muoyo bikole ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="60"> Mu tshikondo tshivua Stéphane mu buloko , ngakatuadija kuteketa mu mikolo ne tshivua kabidi nya mu bisangilu to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="61"> Ngondo dikumi ne umue pashishe , bakapatula Stéphane mu buloko ne yeye kupingana kumbelu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="62"> Mvua ne disanka dia bungi pangakamona Stéphane uyukila nanyi mu muakulu wa tumama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="63"> Biakampitshila ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="64"> Ntshinyi tshivua tshienzeke ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="65"> Pavua Stéphane mu buloko wakalonga muakulu wa tumama wa bena France . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="66"> Pamvua ntangila muvua Stéphane wenza jeste ne bianza biende ne muvuaye wenza ku mêsu , ngakumvua disanka dia bungi bua tshivua bualu ebu mua kungenzela . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="68"> Stéphane wakatuadija kulonga nanyi Bible . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="69"> Tshikondo atshi ke tshingakatuadija kumvua bulelela bua mu Bible bimpe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="70"> Pantshivua muana , mvua ne tshibidilu tshia kutangila bimfuanyi bia mu mikanda yetu idi yumvuija Bible , bua kumona tshidibi biumvuija ne kukonkonona bimpe menemene bua kubueja malu adibi bindongesha mu lungenyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="71"> Mvua mumanye Abalahama , “ kakanunuina ” kende , ne “ musumba munene , ” kadi anu pangakapeta diumvuija dia malu aa mu muakulu wa tumama ke pangakashisha kuumvua bimpe menemene . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="72"> Biakamueneka patoke ne : mvua mupete muakulu wanyi , muakulu umvua munange ne muoyo mujima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="73"> Mpindieu bu munkavua ngumvua bivuabu bulongesha mu bisangilu , biakandenga ku muoyo bikole ne mvua musue kulonga malu a bungi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="74"> Ku diambuluisha dia Stéphane , lumvu luanyi lua Bible lakatungunuka ne kuvula , ne mu 1992 ngakadilambula kudi Yehowa Nzambi ne kutambula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="75"> Kadi nansha mumvua muye kumpala , ntshivua anu ne bundu bua kuyukila ne bantu , bu mumvua tshiyi muibidile kuyukila nabu katshia ku buana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="76"> NGAKALEKELA BUNDU BUMVUA NABU <br>
(trg)="77"> Mu kupita kua matuku , bakasangisha kasumbu ka tumama kamvua ku tshisumbu tshia Pessac uvua kumpenga kua Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="78"> Biakangambuisha bikole , ne meme kutungunuka ne kuya kumpala mu Dîyi dia Nzambi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="79"> Nansha mumvua nduangana ne lutatu lua kuyukila ne bantu , balunda banyi bavua bumvua , bavua benza muabu muonso bua ngumvue malu onso bimpe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="80"> Bena dibaka bakuabu , Gilles ne mukajende Elodie bavua benza muabu muonso bua kuyukila nanyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="81"> Bavua bambikila misangu ya bungi bua kuya kudia nabu anyi kuya kunua nabu kafé bisangilu bimane kujika . <br>
(trg)="82"> Bualu ebu buakangambuluisha bua meme kudia nabu bulunda bukole . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(trg)="83"> Ndi ne disanka dia bungi bua mundi munkatshi mua bantu badi balonda mikenji ya Yehowa ya dinanga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="84"> Anu mu tshisumbu emu ke mumvua mumonangane ne Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="85"> Mushindu uvuaye wenza malu ne buakane uvua unsankisha bikole . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="86"> Nansha mumvua kamama kavua mumone bu bualu to . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="87"> Kadi uvua mumone bu mushindu wa kulongaye mua kuyukila ne kamama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
(trg)="88"> Mvua mulue kumunanga bikole , ne tuetu kuselangana mu 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="89"> Nansha muntshidi ne lutatu lua kuyukila ne bantu , mukajanyi Vanessa udi ungambuluisha bua meme kulekela bundu ne kudiunzulula kudi bakuabu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
(trg)="90"> Ndi nganyisha diambuluisha diende bikole ne ndi nkumbaja majitu anyi bimpe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
(trg)="92"> Tshidimu tshituakaselangana , Betele wa France wa Bantemu ba Yehowa udi mu Louviers wakambikila bua meme kuya kulonga mudimu wa dikudimuna mu ngondo umue . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> In recent years the branch has been working very hard to produce several publications in FSL on DVD . <br>
(trg)="93"> Mu bidimu bidi panshi ebi , Betele udi wenza mudimu bikole bua kupatula mikanda yetu mishilashilangane mu muakulu wa tumama wa mu France mu DVD . <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>
(src)="90"> Giving a Bible talk in French Sign Language <br>
(trg)="94"> Kadi bu muvuaku mudimu wa bungi , Betele uvua musue kusakidila bantu bakuabu mu mudimu wa dikudimuna eu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
(trg)="95"> Meme ne Vanessa tuvua bamone ne : kuenza mudimu ku Betele kuvua diakalenga dinene ne dibenesha dia kudi Yehowa Nzambi , kadi ku lukuabu luseke bivua kabidi bitutonda . <br>
<hr>

(trg)="96"> Tuvua tudiebeja ne : ntshinyi tshivua mua kufikila kasumbu ketu ka tumama ? <br>

(src)="93"> What would we do with our house ? <br>
(trg)="97"> Ntshinyi tshituvua mua kuenza ne nzubu wetu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> Would Vanessa find work in the region ? <br>
(trg)="98"> Vanessa neapete mudimu mu tshimenga etshi anyi ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
(trg)="99"> Yehowa wakatuambuluisha bua kupita bimpe ne malu onso aa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>
(trg)="100"> Mu bulelela , ndi mumone mudi Yehowa mutunange ne munange bantu bonso badi tumama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="97"> Having been involved in translation work , I can better understand all that is done to provide spiritual help for the deaf . <br>
(trg)="102"> Pangakatuadija mudimu wa dikudimuna , ngakumvua bimpe tshionso tshidibu benza bua kuambuluisha tumama bua kumanya Nzambi . <br>
