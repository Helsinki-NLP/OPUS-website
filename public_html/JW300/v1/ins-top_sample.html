(src)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
(trg)="1"> BIOGRAFÍA <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="3"> Kinkawaniyan Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="4"> Kata 1975 akxni xakkgalhi akgtiy kata , kintse akxilhli pi wi tuku xkiʼakgspulama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="5"> Chatum xʼamiga kintse wi tuku makgxtakgli chu lu makasanalh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="6"> Kintse xkinchaxnit , akxilhli pi nipara tsinu ktatsuwilh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="7"> Kmakgatsilh akgtutu kata chu nina xakchuwinan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="8"> Akxni uma kilhtamaku : makuchina kawanilh kifamilia pi akit ni kgaxmata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="9"> Lu aktsujku xakwanit , kinatlatni lamakgxtakgli , wa xlakata kintse akstu kinkamakgastakni akit chu chatiy lakgkgawasan chu chatum tsumat nema tlakg laklankata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="10"> Ama kilhtamaku , kamanan xalak Francia ni chuna xkamasiyanikan chuna la uku , lu xmakgapatinan la xkamasiyanikan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="11"> Maski chuna , akit lu kimakgtayaka nixawa la amakgapitsin tiku ni kgaxmatkgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="12"> Nakkawaniyan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="13"> Milh kilhtamaku , lhuwa makgalhtawakgenanin xlakpuwankgo pi kamanan tiku nila kgaxmatkgo xkamasiyanika nachuwinankgo chu nakatsinikgo likgalhtawakgakgo kilhpin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="14"> Anta kFrancia , niku kstakli nipara tsinu xlakaskinkan namaklakaskina señas kʼescuela . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="15"> Makgapitsi kamanan xkamakachikan kxchakgenkan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="16"> Akxni aktsujku xakwanit akglhuwa horas akgatunu semana xkimasiyani chatum makgalhtawakgena xlakata tlan xakchuwinalh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="17"> Xkinkilhchipa o xkiʼakchipa chu makglhuwa xafuerza xkimatlawi wi tuku xakwa , pero akit nitu xakkgaxmata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="18"> Nila xakkatachuwinan amakgapitsi kamanan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="19"> Umakgolh kata lu kpatinalh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="20"> Akxni xakkgalhi akgchaxan kata kimakanka kʼescuela niku ankgo kamanan tiku ni kgaxmatkgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="21"> Xlimakgtumku tlan xakkatalalin kamanan tiku nila kgaxmatkgo la akit . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="22"> Na ni xlakaskinkan namaklakaskina señas . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="23"> Chu komo xakmaklakaskiw xkinkamakanikkanan o xkinkaʼaklhtankanan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="24"> Pero akinin tsekg xakmaklakaskinaw chu kputsaw tuku kaj akinin xakakgatekgsaw . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="25"> ¡ Tlantiya xakkatachuwinan amakgapitsi kamanan ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="26"> Chuna akgtati kata ktsukulh paxuwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="27"> Pero akxni xakkgalhi akgkaw kata , kimakanka kprimaria niku xʼankgo tiku tlan xkgaxmatkgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="28"> ¡ Lu nitlan kmakgkatsilh ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="29"> Klakpuwa pi putum kamanan tiku nila kgaxmatkgo xnikgonita chu kaj watiya akit xaklama kkatiyatni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="30"> Chuna la xkawaninit makuchina tiku xlakpuwankgo pi kaj paxkat xwa tuku xtlawakgonit , kifamilia ni xkatsikgo señas chu ni xkimaxkikgo talakaskin nakkatalalin kamanan tiku nila kgaxmatkgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="31"> Klakapastakaku akxni kkilalh xconsultorio makuchina tiku putsanani tiku nila kgaxmatkgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="32"> Xmesa xwi maktum libro xaseñas . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> Akxni kʼakxilhli xadibujos klimasiyanilh kimakan chu kwa : « ¡ Klakaskin ama ! » . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="34"> Makuchina lakapala matsekgli . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="35"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="37"> Kintse lu liskujli xlakata xaklatamaw chuna la lakaskin Dios . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="38"> Xkinkalinan ktamakxtumit nema xtlawakgo xtatayananin Jehová , Congregación xalak Mérignac , lakatsu kkachikin Burdeos . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="39"> Ni lu xakʼakgatekgsa tuku xwankan , xwilakgolh tiku xtalakgpalitilhakgo chu xtawilakgo kimpaxtun xlakata xkintsokgnikgo kkapsnat tuku xwankan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="40"> Xlakata lu xkimpaxkikgo chu xkililakgaputsakgo uma lu tlan xkimamakgkatsini . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="41"> Kkinchik , kintse xkintalikgalhtawakga Biblia , pero nikxni kʼakgatekgsli putum tuku xkimasiyani . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> Nachuna xakmakgkatsi la palakachuwina Daniel , akxni chatum ángel wanilh tuku aku xʼama la xla wa : « Kkgaxmatli , pero nila kʼakgatekgsli » ( Daniel 12 : 8 ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> Chu kimpalakata : « Kakxilhli , pero nila kʼakgatekgsli » . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="44"> Maski chuna , xaxlikana tuku masiya Biblia tsinu tsinu lakgchalh kinaku . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="45"> Lu xlakaskinka xakaʼakxilha tuku liwana xakʼakgatekgsa chu xakmakgantaxtiputun . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="46"> Na xakakxilha la xlikatsikgo makgapitsin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="47"> Akgtum liʼakxilhtit , Biblia wan pi ni lakapala nasitsiyaw ( Santiago 5 : 7 , 8 ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="48"> Uma ni lu xakakgatekgsa asta akxni natalan limasiyakgolh uma tayat . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="49"> Chuna la xlikatsikgo natalan uma lu kimakgtayalh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="50"> LALH TUKU NITLAN CHU LU TLAN KITAXTULH <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="51"> Akgtum kilhtamaku , akxni kajku kgawasa xakwanit kkaʼakxilhli ktiji makgapitsi lakgkgawasan tiku nila xkgaxmatkgo xchuwinamakgolh señas . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="52"> Tsekg ktsukulh katalalin chu ktsukulh katsini señas xalak Francia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="53"> Chuntiya xakkan ktamakxtumit , niku xwi chatum xtatayana Jehová xwanikan Stéphane , lu xlakputsa la xkimakgtayalh chu xlakata tlan xkintachuwinalh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="54"> Lu tlan ktalalilh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="55"> Pero lu nitlan tuku lalh : Stéphane tamaknuka kpulachin xlakata ni makgtanuputulh lisoldado . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="56"> Xlakata nialh xwi kimakgalipuwa chu nialhtu xakkatsiputun . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="57"> Asta nialh xakkan ktamakxtumit . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="58"> Titaxtulh akgkawitu papaʼ , Stéphane maxtuka kpulachin chu taspitpa kxchik . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="59"> Lu tlan kmakgkatsilh akxni xla tsukulh kintachuwinan señas . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="60"> Nila xakkanajla . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="61"> ¿ Tuku xlanit ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="62"> Katsinilh señas anta kpulachin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="63"> Akxni xakʼakxilha la xtlawa xmakan chu xlakan tlakg xakpaxuwa akxni xaklakapastaka la xʼama kimakgtaya . <br>
(trg)="64"> UMA KILHTAMAKU KKATSILH TUKU XAXLIKANA XALAK BIBLIA <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="65"> Stéphane tsukulh kilimakgalhtawakge Biblia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="66"> Akxniku liwana ktsukulh akgatekgsa tuku ni xakakgatekgsnit xaxlikana xlakata Biblia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="67"> Akxni aktsujku xakwanit lu xaklakgati xakakxilha dibujos nema liminkgo likgalhtawakga chu xakkaputsa tiku kalichuwinankan chu lu kuenta xaktlawa dibujos xlakata chuntiya xakkalakapastakli . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="68"> Xakkatsi xlakata Abrahán , « [ x ] kamanan » , chu xlakata « lhuwa tachixkuwitat » o lhuwa latamanin , pero asta akxni kimasiyanika señas akxniku kkatsilh tuku xkilhchanima umakgolh tachuwin ( Génesis 22 : 15 - 18 ; Apocalipsis [ Revelación ] 7 : 9 ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="69"> Xlikana pi wa señas , tachuwin nema chan kkinaku . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="70"> Xlakata tlan xakakgatekgsa tuku xwankan ktamakxtumit , putum tuku xlichuwinankan xchan kinaku chu tlakg xakkatsiniputun tuku wan Biblia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="71"> Xlakata Stéphane xkimakgtaya tlakg xakakgatekgstilhama Biblia , chu kata 1992 ktamakamastanilh Jehová chu ktamunulh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="72"> Maski lhuwata tuku xakkatsininit , lu xakmaxanan chu ni xakwan tuku xakmakgkatsi , xlakata akxni aktsujku xakwanit niti xaktachuwinan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="73"> NIALH LU KMAXANALH <br>
(trg)="74"> Ktsukulh katatamakxtumi akgtum grupo tiku xchuwinankgo señas , chu alistalh xlakan makxtum talakgolh congregación xalak Pessac , barrio xalak Burdeos . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="75"> Uma lu kimakgtayalh xlakata tlakg stakli kintakanajla . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="76"> Ni lu lhuwa tuku xakakgatekgsa , pero kiʼamigos tiku xkgaxmatkgo xkimakgtayakgo xlakata liwana xakakgatekgsli tuku xkiwanikan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="77"> Gilles chu Elodie akgtum tamakgaxtokgat xlakputsakgo la tlan xkintachuwinankgolh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="78"> Makglhuwa akxni ksputa tamakxtumit xkilenkgo xchikkan xakwayanaw o xakwayaw kape chu chuna lu tlan ktsukuw lu tlan latalalinaw . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(trg)="79"> ¡ Lu lipaxuw katatawilakan tiku tlawakgo xtalakaskin Dios ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="80"> Anta uma kcongregación klakgapasli Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="81"> Lu klakgatilh pi xla lu tlan xlakapastaknan chu xlakgati katatlawalh tuku xaʼakgstitum . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="82"> Xla ni lakpuwa pi nila xkintachuwinan , wata xlakpuwan la tlan nakatsini natachuwinan tiku nila kgaxmata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
(trg)="83"> Tuku xtlawa chalh kkinaku , chu ktamakgaxtokgwi kata 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="84"> Maski ni lu klakgati kchuwinan , xla kimakgtayanit nialh lu nakmaxanan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
(trg)="85"> Lu kpaxtikatsini Vanessa xlakata kimakgtaya tlan nakmakgantaxti tuku klakgaya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
(trg)="86"> ATANU XTAMASKIWIN JEHOVÁ <br>

<hr>
(src)="88"> In recent years the branch has been working very hard to produce several publications in FSL on DVD . <br>
(src)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>
(src)="90"> Giving a Bible talk in French Sign Language <br>

<hr>
(src)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
(trg)="89"> Akit chu Vanessa lu lanka xtalakgalhaman Jehová kʼakxilhaw xlakata kmakgtayanalh ksucursal , maski pulana lu xaklilakgaputsayaw . <br>

(src)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
(trg)="93"> Pero Jehová lakkaxtlawalh pulakatunu tuku xaklilakgaputsayaw . <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>
(trg)="94"> Lu kmakgkatsilh pi Jehová xkinkapaxkiyan akit chu kimpuskat chu putum tiku nila kgaxmatkgo . <br>
