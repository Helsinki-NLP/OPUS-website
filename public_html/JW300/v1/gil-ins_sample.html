(trg)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> Ana Rongorongo Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> N 1975 ao ai uoua iai au ririki ngke e a tibwa kunea tinau ae iai te bwai ae kaokoro irou . <br>
(trg)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> Ngke e tobwaai tinau , ao e a bwaka naba te bwai teuana ae tinebu iroun raoraona temanna ao n rangi ni karongoa . <br>
(trg)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> E bon norai tinau bwa I aki kubanako . <br>
(trg)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> Ngke ai tenua au ririki , I bon teimatoa naba ni babanga n taetae . <br>
(trg)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Imwina , a a kaongoaki au utu te rongorongo ae kauruakinano bwa e a kakoauaa raoi te taokita ae mwaatai bwa I bonotaninga ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> A buuraure au karo ngke tao nimaua tabun au ririki , ao e a boni kaikawaira tinara n tii ngaia , ngai ma tariu ake a a ikawai riki aika uoman mwaane ao temanna te aine . <br>
(trg)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> N taai akanne , a aki reireiaki ataei aika bonotaninga i Buranti n aron ae kakaraoaki ngkai , ao a karekea rawawatau ae korakora n tabetai aanga n reirei ake a kakabonganaaki . <br>
(trg)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Ma man uarerekeu , iai kakabwaia ake I karekei aika a aki reke irouia ataei aika bonotaninga aika bati . <br>
(trg)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Ongora bwa N nang kabwarabwaraa . <br>
(trg)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> Inanon tabeua te tai , a a bati taan reirei aika a kakoauaa bwa a riai n reireiaki ataei aika bonotaninga rinanoni kamanenaan te taetae ao tarataraani kakammwakurin te ria . <br>
(trg)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Ni koauana , e rangi n tabuaki te taetae n te bai n tain te reirei n te tabo are I ikawairake iai i aoni Buranti . <br>
(trg)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> A boni kabaeaki naba i akuia baia ataei aika bonotaninga n tain te reirei . <br>
(trg)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Ngke tao ai teuana nakon nimaua au ririki , I rereirei tabeua te aoa ni katoa wiki ma te aine ae mwaatai n reireinia ataei aika bonotaninga . <br>
(trg)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> E tauaki mwangaiu ke atu ao I kairoroaki bwa N na okioki ni kakairi ni bwanaa ake I aki kona n ongo . <br>
(trg)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I bon aki kona n taetae ma ataei ake tabeman riki . <br>
(trg)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> Bon akanne ririki ake I rangi n rawawata iai . <br>
(trg)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Ngkanne ngke ai onoua au ririki , I a karinaki n te kuura ae a mamatu iai ataei n te tabo n reirei ae onoti ibukia ataei aika bonotaninga . <br>
(trg)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Ai bon tibwa au moantai aei n taetae ma ataei aika bonotaninga naba . <br>
(trg)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> E bon tabuaki naba ikai te taetae n te bai . <br>
(trg)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Ngkana ti taetae n te bai n tain te reirei , ti katuuaaeaki n oreaki nimoimoini baira ke waera ke ni buritaki irannatura . <br>
(trg)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Ma e ngae n anne , ti boni karabaira naba n taetae n te bai ni kamanenaan ara tua ake ti karaoi . <br>
(trg)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> N tokina , I a kona n taetae ma ataei ake tabeman riki . <br>
(trg)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> Ai ngaia are a a moanaki au ririki aika kakukurei aika aua . <br>
(trg)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> Ngke ai tebwina au ririki , I a kamwaingaki nakon te moan rinan n reirei ibukia ataei aika aki bonotaninga . <br>
(trg)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> I a bon rangi n nanokawaki ! <br>
(trg)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I iangoia bwa titeboo ma a a bane ni mate ataei aika bonotaninga ao ai bon tii ngai te nikira n te aonnaba aei . <br>
(trg)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> N touani mwin aia taeka n reirei taokita ake a tabeaianga bwa I kona ni kabuai kakabwaiaau mani bwainnaorakiau ibukin te taetae , a a bon aki reireinaki n te taetae n te bai kaain au utu ao I aki kariaiakaki naba ni bobotaki ma ataei aika bonotaninga . <br>
(trg)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> I teimatoa naba n ururinga kawaran te taokita ae mwaatai n te aoraki ae te bonotaninga are iai ana boki ibukin te taetae n te bai i aon ana taibora . <br>
(trg)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> Ngke I nori taamnei i tinanikuna , I kotei ao I taku : “ I tangira te bwai anne ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Ma e waekoa te taokita ni karabaa te boki . <br>
(trg)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> * <br>
(trg)="35"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> E kataia tinau ni kaikawaira bwa ti na maiuakini booto n reirei man te Baibara . <br>
(trg)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> E kakairira nakoni bobotaki n aia ekaretia Ana Tia Kakoaua Iehova ae te Mérignacion , i rarikin Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Tii teutana otau man taiani bobotaki ibukina bwa I uarereke . <br>
(trg)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> Ma e ngae n anne , a uatei aomata aika kakaokoro n tekateka ni kaaniai ao ni korei baike a taekinaki . <br>
(trg)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> E anaaki nanou n aia tangira ao aia mwamwannano . <br>
(trg)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> I reirei ma tinau n te Baibara ni mwengara ma I aki ota raoi ni baike I reiakin . <br>
(trg)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> E kuri n titeboo au namakin ma te burabeti are Taniera are e kangai imwin anganakina te taetae ni burabeti iroun te anera : “ I ongo ma I aki ataia . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> Ma irou , bon te bwai ae “ I noria ma I aki ota iai . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> Ma e ngae n anne , I a reiakini moan reirei man te Baibara tabeua , teutana imwin teutana . <br>
(trg)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> I kawakini baike I a ota raoi iai ao I kataia ni maiuakin . <br>
(trg)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> I karekea naba reireiau mani matakuakinan aroaroia tabemwaang . <br>
(trg)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> N te katoto , e taekinaki n te Baibara bwa ti na taotaon nanora . <br>
(trg)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I aki ota raoi n te taeka ae taotaonan nanora . <br>
(trg)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> Ma imwini matakuakinaia raao n te onimaki n aroia ni kaotiota te aroaro aei , I a kona n ota iai . <br>
(trg)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Ni koauana , I rangi ni kakabwaiaaki man te ekaretia ni Kristian . <br>
(trg)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> N te bong teuana ngke ai tebwi tabun au ririki , ao I a noriia rooro n rikirake tabeman aika bonotaninga n te kawai aika taetae n te bai i marenaia . <br>
(trg)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> I a moanna ni kakarabaai ni bobotaki ma ngaiia ao ni moanna n reiakina Te Taetae ni Buranti n te Taetae n te Bai . <br>
(trg)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> I waakinaanako irirakini bobotaki ni Kristian , ike e a tii tatangirai naba temanna te roro n rikirake ae te tia uarongorongo ae te mwaane ae Stéphane . <br>
(trg)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> E rangi ni kekeiaki n taetae ma ngai , ao I namakina au itoman ae nene ma ngaia . <br>
(trg)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Ma e ngae n anne , iai te bwarannano ae korakora ae N nang aitara ma ngaia . <br>
(trg)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> E a kabureaki Stéphane ibukin teimatoana n rawa n ira te taanga ni buaka . <br>
(trg)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> I a bon rangi n nanokawaki ! <br>
(trg)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> E a moanna n rangi ni bwara nanou ao I a aikoa iririi bobotaki ngkai ai akea i rarikiu Stéphane . <br>
(trg)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Tebwi ma teuana te namwakaina imwina , e a kaotinakoaki Stéphane man te karabuuti ao e a oki . <br>
(trg)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Iangoa kubanakou ngke e a moanna Stéphane ni maroro ma ngai n te taetae n te bai . <br>
(trg)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> I aki kona ni kakoauaa te bae I noria ! <br>
(trg)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Tera ae riki ? <br>
(trg)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> E a bon tia n reiakina Te Taetae ni Buranti n te Taetae n te Bai n te karabuuti . <br>
(trg)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I matakuakina kakammwakurini baina ao teini ubuna , ao e a rikirake kukureiu ngke I a karaua n iangoia ae e a kona ni kabwarabwaraa te koaua n te aro ae mataata riki nakoiu . <br>
(trg)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> E a moana au reirei Stéphane man te Baibara . <br>
(trg)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> Man te tai anne , I a moanna n tomatomai otau ni koaua nako man te Baibara ake I a tia n reiakini ngkoa . <br>
(trg)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> Ngke I uarereke , I kani mamataku n taamnei aika kantara n ara boki aika boto man te Baibara , ni kabotauia naake bon rongorongoia ao n neneri karakinaia ni kabane bwa e aonga ni bwanin raoi n au iango . <br>
(trg)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> I ataa taekan Aberaam , ana “ kariki , ” ao te “ koraki ae uanao , ” ma I a tibwa ota raoi n te bae nanonaki iai ngke a a kabwarabwaraaki n te taetae n te bai . <br>
(trg)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> E teretere raoi bwa e a reke irou au taetae ae I ota raoi iai ae I tangiria . <br>
(trg)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> Ibukina bwa I a kona ngkai n ota ni baika taekinaki ni bobotaki , e a ringaki nanou ao I a bwarua reiakinan ae bati riki . <br>
(trg)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> E teimatoa n rikirake au atatai man te Baibara n ana ibuobuoki Stéphane , ike I a katabua iai maiu nakon Iehova ae te Atua ao ni bwabetitoaki n 1992 . <br>
(trg)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> N aki ongea rikiraken au atatai are e a tia n reke , I bon teimatoa naba ni maamaa ao e kangaanga irou te bobotaki ma aomata riki tabeman ibukina bwa I aki kona n itoman ma aomata ngke I rangi n uarereke . <br>
(trg)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> N tokina , e a ikotaki te kurubu ni bonotaninga are I mena iai ma te ekaretia i Pessac ibukia bonotaninga , n aonon Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> E bon rangi ni buokai anne ao e a teimatoa n rikirake au onimaki . <br>
(trg)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> E ngae ngke I teimatoa ni kabokorakora ma tianakin au konabwai n taetae , ma a boni buokai raoi raoraou ake a aki bonotaninga bwa N na ota ni bwaai ni kabane . <br>
(trg)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> A kakorakoraia naba n aaro aika okoro taangaia Gilles ma Elodie bwa a na maroro ma ngai . <br>
(trg)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> A aki toki ni kaoai bwa ti na kaai n amwarake ke ni moi n te kobee imwini bobotaki , ike e a rikirake iai te iraorao ae kakukurei . <br>
(trg)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Ai kakukureira te mena i buakoia aomata aika toua mwin aroaron te Atua aika e kaotiotaki iai te tangira ! <br>
(trg)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(trg)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> Bon aei te ekaretia are I kaitiboo iai ma Nei Vanessa ae rangi n anainano aroarona . <br>
(trg)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> E reke tangirana irou man ana nanoanga ao kakaraoan ae eti . <br>
(trg)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> E aki iangoa bonotaningau bwa te bwai n tutuki n ara maroro , ma e iangoia bwa te anga are e na kona iai n reiakina arona ni maroro ma ae bonotaninga . <br>
(trg)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> I a bon tangiria , ao ti mare n 2005 . <br>
(trg)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> E ngae ngke I noria bwa e kangaanga irou te maroro raoi ma aomata , ma e boni buokai Vanessa ni buakana maamaau n te aro are I a biririmoa ni kataetaeia aomata . <br>
(trg)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I boni kakaitau ibukini boutokaau irouna ngkai I tabe ni karaoi mwiokoau . <br>
(trg)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> N te ririki are ti mareaki iai , I a kaoaki man aia aobiti n tararua Ana Tia Kakoaua Iehova i Louviers i aoni Buranti , bwa N na kaea te kataneiai ibukin te mwakuri n raitaeka ae maanna teuana te namwakaina . <br>
(trg)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> N ririki aika tibwa nako imwaini kaoakin teuaei , a rangi ni mwakuri korakora kaain te aobiti n tararua ni karaoi booki tabeua aika boto man te Baibara n Te Taetae ni Buranti n te Taetae n te Bai n te DVD . <br>
(trg)="88"> In recent years the branch has been working very hard to produce several publications in FSL on DVD . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Ma ibukini batin riki te mwakuri n taai aika imwaira , e a kainnanoaki te boutoka nakon te tiim n raitaeka . <br>
(trg)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>

(trg)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> Tera ae na riki ngkanne nakon ara kurubu n te taetae n te bai ? <br>
(trg)="92"> What would happen to our sign - language group ? <br>

(trg)="93"> What would we do with our house ? <br>
<hr>

(trg)="94"> Would Vanessa find work in the region ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="90"> E boni katauraoi kaekaan ara titiraki ni kabane Iehova n te aro ae rangi n tamaroa . <br>
(trg)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> I namakina ana tangira Iehova ibukira ao ibukia naba aika bonotaninga . <br>
(trg)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>

(src)="92"> Ibukina bwa I karaoa naba te mwakuri n raitaeka , I a kona n ota raoi riki ni bwaai ni kabane aika katauraoaki ibukini buokan aia onimaki aika bonotaninga . <br>
(trg)="97"> Having been involved in translation work , I can better understand all that is done to provide spiritual help for the deaf . <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> Ai kakukureira noraia raao n te onimaki aika bati aika a kataia n taetae ma ngai ! <br>
(trg)="98"> And what a pleasure to see many fellow workers try to communicate with me ! <br>
<hr>
