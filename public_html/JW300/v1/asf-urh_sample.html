(trg)="27"> Ọnana orọnvwọn rẹ Inenikristi eje che ru , a je guọnọ a ke sa wanvrẹ ukpokpogho rode rọ cha na . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> You do well , therefore , to consider three questions that may help you to see if you are ready for baptism . <br>
(trg)="28"> ( Matiu 28 : 19 , 20 ; 1 Pita 3 : 21 ) Omaebrophiyame , ọyen odjephia rẹ uve wẹn wọ vwọ ga Jihova bẹdẹ . <br>

(trg)="31"> ( 3 ) Me riẹn obo ro mudiaphiyọ me vwọ vwomakpahotọ kẹ Jihova ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Let us examine those questions . <br>
(trg)="32"> E jẹ a fuẹrẹn enọ nana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> 4 , 5 . ( a ) Why is baptism not for older people only ? <br>
(trg)="33"> 4 , 5 . ( a ) Diesorọ a sa vwọ tanẹ ọ dia ihwo re kpakore ọvo yen bromaphiyame - e ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> ( b ) What does it mean for a Christian to be mature ? <br>
(trg)="34"> ( b ) Die yen o mudiaphiyọ ra vwọ ghwanre tedje ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> The Bible does not suggest that baptism is a step to be taken only by those who are older or who have reached at least an age at which certain legal rights may be granted . <br>
(trg)="35"> Baibol na tare nẹ ihwo re kpakore ọvo yen bromaphiyame - e , yẹrẹ o vwo ikpe rẹ ohwo te tavwen o ki se bromaphiyame - e . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> We read at Proverbs 20 : 11 : “ Even a child is known by his actions , whether his behavior is pure and right . ” <br>
(trg)="36"> Isẹ 20 : 11 , de se : “ Tobọ uruemu rẹ omotete ọvo ri dje phia , sẹ obo ro ruẹ shephihọ eyẹ ọ chọre . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> One who is somewhat younger can realize what it means to do what is right and to be dedicated to his Creator . <br>
(trg)="37"> Ọtiọyena , omotete sa riẹn obo ro mudiaphiyọ re vwo ru obo ri yovwirin , je vwọ vwomakpahotọ kẹ Ọghẹnẹ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> Thus , baptism is an important and appropriate step for a young person who has manifested considerable maturity and has made a dedication to Jehovah . ​ — Prov . <br>
(src)="39"> 20 : 7 . <br>
(trg)="38"> Kọyensorọ , omaebrophiyame vwọ dia obo re ghanre , ro ji fo vwọ kẹ eghene ro djerephia nẹ ọyen ghwanre tedje re , rọ je vwomakpahotọ vwọ kẹ Jihova nure . — Isẹ 20 : 7 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> What does it mean to be mature ? <br>
(trg)="39"> Die yen o mudiaphiyọ ra vwọ ghwanre tedje ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> Maturity involves more than physical growth . <br>
(trg)="40"> Ọkiọvo , ọ diẹ ikpe yẹrẹ ugboma yen a vwọ riẹn sẹ ohwo ghwanre tedje re - e . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> The Bible says that mature people “ have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> Baibol na tare nẹ , ihwo re ghwanre tedje , eyen ihwo ri yono “ ọhọ ” yẹrẹ ẹgba iroro rayen , ayen sa vwọ riẹn ofẹnẹ rẹ obo ri yovwirin vẹ obo re chọre . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Thus , mature people know what is right in Jehovah’s eyes and are resolved in their heart to stick to it . <br>
(trg)="42"> ( Hibru 5 : 14 ) Ohwo rọ ghwanre tedje riẹn obo ri yovwirin , o ji brorhiẹn ro vwo ruo vẹ ubiudu rọyen . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> As a result , they are not easily swayed to do what is wrong ; nor do they always have to be prodded to do what is right . <br>
(trg)="43"> Ọtiọyena , a sa fobọ phiẹn vwo ruẹ obo re chọre - e . <br>
(trg)="44"> Ọ diẹ ọkieje yen ohwo ọfa je vwọ vuẹ obo ri yovwirin tavwen o ki ruo - o . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Really , it is only reasonable to expect that a young person who gets baptized will uphold God’s standards even when parents or other adults are not present . ​ — Compare Philippians 2 : 12 . <br>
(trg)="45"> A guọnọre nẹ eghene ro bromaphiyame ru obo ri yovwirin , ọ da tobọ dianẹ ọsẹ vẹ oni rọyen yẹrẹ ihwo efa hẹ etiyi - in . — Ni Filipae 2 : 12 . <br>

(trg)="46"> 6 , 7 . ( a ) Djisẹ rẹ egbabọse rẹ Daniẹl rhiẹromrẹ vwẹ Babilọn . ( b ) Idjerhe vọ yen Daniẹl vwo djephia nẹ ọyen ghwanre tedje ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> Can young people really demonstrate such maturity ? <br>
(trg)="47"> Eghene sa ghene ghwanre tedje ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Well , consider the Bible example of Daniel . <br>
(trg)="48"> Roro kpahen udje rẹ Daniẹl . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> He may have been in his early teens when he was forcibly taken from his parents into exile in Babylon . <br>
(trg)="49"> Ọ sa dianẹ ọke rọ vwọ hẹ eghene yen e vwo muo jẹ ọsẹ vẹ oni rọyen vwo kpo Babilọn . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Suddenly , Daniel found himself living among a people who had a completely different concept of right and wrong . <br>
(trg)="50"> Daniẹl da rhe mrẹ oma rọyen vwẹ uvwre rẹ ihwo ri nene irhi rẹ Ọghẹnẹ - ẹ . <br>
(trg)="51"> Ẹkẹvuọvo , e jẹ a nabọ fuẹrẹn ẹdia rẹ Daniẹl . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> In addition , there was another challenge to Daniel’s situation : He was treated as someone special in Babylon . <br>
(trg)="52"> Ihwo vwẹ ẹro ọghanghanre vwo no vwẹ Babilọn . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> In fact , Daniel was one of a number of young people carefully chosen to stand before the king ! <br>
(trg)="53"> Ọyen ọvo usun rẹ ighene ra nabọ sane nẹ e ga ovie na . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Daniel seemingly had opportunities in Babylon that he might never have had in Israel . <br>

<hr>
(src)="54"> How did young Daniel react to all of this ? <br>
(trg)="55"> Die yen Daniẹl ruru ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Was he seduced by the glitter and glamour of Babylon ? <br>
(src)="56"> Did he allow his new surroundings to change his identity or sabotage his faith ? <br>
(trg)="56"> Ọ vwẹ uphẹn kẹ ihwo rẹ Babilọn nẹ i wene oka rẹ ohwo rọ hepha , yẹrẹ e guọghọ esegbuyota rọyen ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Not at all ! <br>
(trg)="57"> Ẹjo , kakaka ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> The Bible says that while in Babylon , Daniel “ resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself ” with anything associated with false worship . <br>
(trg)="58"> Baibol na vuẹ avwanre nẹ , ọ vwọ hẹ Babilọn , Daniẹl brorhiẹn vwẹ ẹwẹn rọyen nẹ o che se “ gbe oma rọye ẹgua - a , ” nẹ ọ cha kẹnoma kẹ kemu kemu ro churobọ si ẹga rẹ efian . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> Daniel showed remarkable maturity ! <br>
(trg)="59"> ( Daniẹl 1 : 8 ) Ọyena djerephia nẹ ọ ghwanre tedje dẹn ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> A mature young person does not act like a friend of God at the Kingdom Hall but a friend of the world at school ( See paragraph 8 ) <br>
(trg)="60"> Eghene ọshare ro meruẹ kerẹ ugbeyan rẹ Ọghẹnẹ vwevunrẹ Ọguan Ruvie , o de te isikuru o mi rhe ru kerẹ ugbeyan rẹ akpọ na <br>

(src)="62"> What can you learn from Daniel’s example ? <br>
(trg)="62"> Die wo se yono nẹ udje rẹ Daniẹl rhe ? <br>

(trg)="63"> Eghene rọ ghwanre tedje yọnrọn esegbuyota rọyen gan , tobọ vwẹ ọke rẹ edavwini . <br>

(trg)="66"> Ukperẹ ọtiọyen , ọ fuevun ọkieje , tobọ vwẹ ọke rẹ ọdavwini . — Se Ẹfesọs 4 : 14 , 15 . <br>

(src)="69"> Of course , no one is perfect ; young people as well as adults make mistakes from time to time . <br>
(trg)="70"> Vwọrẹ uyota , avwanre gbare - e . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> Still , as you are considering baptism , it would be wise to analyze to what extent you are resolved in your heart to stick to Jehovah’s standards . <br>
(trg)="71"> Te ighene te imiragua ruẹ chọ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> How could you measure the strength of your resolve ? <br>
(trg)="72"> ( Aghwoghwo 7 : 20 ) Ẹkẹvuọvo , wọ da guọnọ bromaphiyame , ofori wọ vwọ nabọ fuẹrẹn oma wẹn sẹ wo muegbe wọ vwọ yọnrọn irhi rẹ Jihova . <br>

(trg)="77"> Ọnana da dia ọdavwini vwọ kẹ wẹ , wo se vwo ẹruọ rẹ oborẹ ọhọre rẹ Jihova hepha ? — Ẹfesọs 5 : 17 . <br>

(trg)="78"> Diesorọ ọ vwọ ghanre a vwọ riẹn ẹkpahọnphiyọ rẹ enọ yena ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> They are meant to help you put baptism in the right perspective . <br>
(trg)="79"> Kidie e cha chọn avwanre uko vwọ riẹn oborẹ omaebrophiyame ghanre te . <br>

(src)="80"> As mentioned earlier , baptism symbolizes that you made a solemn promise to Jehovah himself . <br>

(trg)="85"> Baibol na tare nẹ ihwo rẹ Jihova eje , tobọ te ighene , cha vwomakpahotọ ga “ ọphọphẹ . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> So a person who is contemplating baptism needs to be sure that this is his or her personal desire . <br>
(src)="87"> That might call for self - scrutiny on your part . <br>
(src)="88"> Why ? <br>
(trg)="86"> ( Une Rẹ Ejiro 110 : 3 ) Ọtiọyena , ohwo rọ guọnọ bromaphiyame ko vwo imuẹro nẹ ọnana orhiẹn romobọ rọyen . <br>

(trg)="88"> Ọ sa dianẹ wọ mrẹ ihwo buebun ri bromaphiyame , ọkiọvo igbeyan wẹn yẹrẹ iniọvo wẹn . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> If that is indeed your situation , what should you be careful about ? <br>
(src)="93"> Be alert that you do not come to view baptism as little more than a coming - of - age custom that all young people follow sooner or later . <br>

(trg)="97"> Ẹkpahọnphiyọ wẹn vwọ kẹ enọ nana se dje oborẹ oyerinkugbe wẹn vẹ Jihova kpẹkpẹ te . <br>
