(src)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
(trg)="1"> WECHE MA NE OTIMORE E NGIMA NG’ATO <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> Kaka iwachonwa gi Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="3"> E higa mar 1975 kane an jahigni ariyo , minwa ne ofwenyo ni gimoro ne ok ni kare kuoma . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="4"> Osiepne moro ne olwaro gimoro mapek piny mogoyo goko matek , an to ne ok akithni kata matin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="5"> Ne achopo jahigni adek to ne pod ok anyal wuoyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="6"> Kanyo ema lakteche ne ofwenyo gima ne rach kuoma ; kare ne an radin chuth ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="7"> Jonyuolna ne owere chuth kane pod an nyathi , omiyo mama ne opidhowa ka en kende , an , owetena ariyo , koda nyaminwa achiel . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="8"> Gie kindeno e piny Faransa , nyithindo ma itgi odino ne ok puonj e yo mitiyogo tinde , kendo yore ma ne ipuonjogigo samoro ne miyo nyithindogo chandore ahinya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="9"> Kata kamano , a e tinna , aseyudo ber mang’eny ma rodin mamoko ok yudi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="10"> We alernu kaka mano ne obet . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(trg)="11"> Kane an jahigni abich <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="12"> Kuom kinde , jopuonj mang’eny ne paro ni onego opuonj nyithindo ma rodin kiwuoyo kodgi e yo mapile kendo kipuonjogi somo dhog ng’at mawuoyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="13"> E piny Faransa kama ne aponie , tiyo gi dho momni e skunde ne ogo marfuk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="14"> Moko kuom nyithindo ma rodin ne itweyo lwetegi gi kang’egi sama gin e klas . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="15"> Kuom higni mogwaro e tinna , japuonj moro ne tiyo gi seche mang’eny juma ka juma mondo opuonja wuoyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="16"> Ne imako dhoga kata wiya kendo ne ichuna wacho gik ma ne an to ok awinj . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="17"> Ne ok anyal wuoyo gi nyithindo mamoko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="18"> Ne achandora ahinya e hignigo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="19"> Kae to kane achopo higni auchiel , ne otera e skul mar rodin ma ne en boding ’ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="20"> Mano e kama ne akwongo romoe gi nyithindo mamoko ma rodin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="21"> To kae bende , ne otam ji tiyo gi dho momni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="22"> Kane oyudwa kwatiyo gi dho momni e klas , ne idwong’o omuode mag lith lwetewa kata ne iywayowa gi yie wiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="23"> Kata kamano , ne wachuogo dho momo ma ne watiyogo apanda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="24"> Koro , ne anyalo timo gima ne asegombo ahinya ​ —⁠ wuoyo gi nyithindo wetena . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="25"> Omiyo ne amor ahinya kuom higni ang’wen ma ne an kuno . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="26"> Kata kamano , kane achopo jahigni apar , ne otera e skul mar praimari mar nyithindo maok rodin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="27"> Wachno ne oturo chunya ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="28"> Ne aparo ni nyithindo duto ma itgi odino ne otho kendo ni an kenda ema ne adong ’ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="29"> Nikech lakteche ne neno ni tiyo gi dho momni biro rucho gik moko te ma ne osepuonja , joodwa ne ok opuonjore dho momni kendo ne itama kikora gi nyithindo mamoko ma rodin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="30"> Pod aparo maler chieng ’ ma ne adhi neno laktar moro mi aneno buk mar dho momni e mesane . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="31"> Kane aneno piche ma ne nie tok bugno , ne asiemo bugno ka awacho niya , “ Miya bugno ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="32"> Laktarno ne opando bugno piyo piyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="33"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="34"> Minwa ne otemo ahinya puonjowa dak kaluwore gi chike mag Muma a e tinwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="35"> Ne ojaterowa e chokruoge mag Joneno mag Jehova e kanyakla mar Mérignac machiegni gi Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="36"> Kane an nyathi , ne anyalo mana puonjora weche matin ahinya e chokruogego . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="37"> Kata kamano , joma opogore opogore ne wilore bet buta mondo gindikna gik ma ne ipuonjo kuno . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="38"> Ne amor ahinya gi kaka ne gihera kendo ne gidewa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="39"> Mamawa ne puonja Muma ka wan pacho , kata kamano , gik ma ne opuonja ne ok donjna malong’o . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="40"> Ne awinjo mana kaka janabi Daniel nowinjo kane malaika omiye weche mokor , mowacho niya : “ Nawinjo , to . . . ok nodonjona . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> ( Daniel 12 : 8 ) Korka kora , to “ ne aneno gik moko to ne ok ang’eyo tiendgi . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="42"> Kata kamano , adiera ma gin mise mag ng’eyo Muma ne ochako donjona mos mos . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="43"> Ne ahero ahinya gigo ma ne awinjo tiendgi maler , kendo ne atemo tiyo kodgi e ngimana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="44"> Bende ne apuonjora kuom ng’iyo kaka jomoko ne timo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="45"> Kuom ranyisi , Muma nyisowa ni wabed joma hore . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="46"> Ne ok ang’eyo maber tiend bedo ng’at ma hore . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="47"> Kata kamano , kuom ng’iyo kaka owete ma Jokristo ne nyiso kidono , ne apuonjora gima tiend horuok en . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="48"> Kuom adier , kanyakla mar Jokristo osekonya ahinya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="49"> Stéphane nokonya ng’eyo tiend weche ma ne nie Muma <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="50"> Chieng ’ moro , ka an rawera , ne aneno rowere mamoko ma rodin ka tiyo gi dho momni e wang’a yo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="51"> Ne achako tudora kodgi ling ’ ling ’ kendo ne achako puonjora French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="52"> Ne adhi nyime dhi e chokruoge mag Jokristo kendo Janeno moro ma rawera miluongo ni Stéphane ne omako lweta . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="53"> Ne otimo kinda ahinya mondo wawinjre kode e wuoyo , kendo mano ne omiyo achako here ahinya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="54"> Kata kamano , ne ok ang’eyo ni gimoro malit ne dhi timorena . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="55"> Ne otwe Stéphane e jela nikech yiene kaka Jakristo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="56"> Nikech Stéphane ne onge , chunya ne onyosore ahinya ma aweyo dhi e chokruoge . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="57"> Bang ’ dweche apar gachiel , ne ogony Stéphane moduogo pacho . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="58"> Par ane kaka piny ne ogoya nyang’eng ’ kane Stéphane owuoyo koda kotiyo gi dho momni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="59"> Ne ahum nono ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="60"> Ne awuoro ahinya kaka ne opuonjore dhokno . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="61"> Kare kinde ma ne Stéphane nie jela , ne opuonjore FSL . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="62"> Neno ka Stéphane tiyo gi lwetene koda wang’e kowacho dho momni nomiya mor ahinya nikech mano ne nyiso ni ne odhi konya kama duong ’ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="63"> Stéphane nochako timo puonjruok mar Muma koda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="64"> Gie kindeno , ne achako neno kaka puonj mag Muma ma ne asepuonjora otudore . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="65"> Kane an nyathi , ne ahero ahinya ng’iyo piche mabeyo mayudore e bugewa malero Muma , kendo ne anono pichego ahinya mondo omi gigurre e pacha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="66"> Ne oyudo ang’eyo wach Ibrahim , ‘ kothe , ’ koda “ oganda mang’ongo , ” kata kamano , ne awinjo tiendgi maler mana ka ne opuonjagi e dho momni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="67"> ( Chakruok 22 : 15 - 18 ; Fweny 7 : 9 ) Anyalo wacho ni koro ne ayudo dhok mowinjore koda chuth , dhok madonjo e chunya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="68"> Nikech koro ne awinjo tiend gik mipuonjo e chokruoge , wechego koro ne mulo chunya kendo ne amedo bedo gi siso mar puonjruok weche momedore . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="69"> Kaka Stéphane ne medo konya , ne amedo ng’eyo gik ma Muma puonjo , kendo e higa mar 1992 , ne achiwora ne Jehova Nyasaye ma obatisa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="70"> Kata obedo ni ne asetimo dongruok e okang ’ moro , ne pod aluor kendo wuoyo gi ji ne tekna nimar ne en gima ne ok atim a e tinna . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="71"> Bang’e , grup matin mar rodin ma ne antiere ne oriw gi kanyakla mar Pessac , ma ne ni Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="72"> Mano ne okonya ahinya , kendo ne atimo dongruok e winjruokna gi Nyasaye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="73"> Kata obedo ni pod ne anyagora gi wuoyo gi ji , osiepena ma ne ok rodin ne timo matek mondo gine ni awinjo gik moko duto e chokruok . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="74"> Dichwo moro miluongo ni Gilles gi chiege Elodie , notimo duto ma ginyalo mondo giwuo koda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="75"> Ne gijorwaka kinde ka kinde mondo wachiem kanyachiel kendo mano ne omiyo wabedo osiepe machiegni ahinya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(trg)="76"> Mano kaka bedo e kind joma nyiso hera kaka mar Nyasaye en gimaber ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="77"> Vanessa chiega konya ahinya <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="78"> Kanyaklani ema ne aromoe gi jaber miluongo ni Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="79"> Gimomiyo ne ahere en ni nodewo ji ahinya kendo nohero timbe makare . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="80"> Kar neno ni bedona radin en gima pek , noneno mano kaka thuolo maber mar puonjruok wuoyo gi ng’at ma radin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
(trg)="81"> Omiyo ne ahere ahinya mi wakendore e higa mar 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="82"> Kata obedo ni ok an ng’at ma jawuoyo , Vanessa osekonya timo kinda mondo alo luorona kendo abed thuolo wuoyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
(trg)="83"> Amor ahinya gi kaka otega e chopo migepena . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
(trg)="84"> Higa ma ne wakendoreno , ne oluonga e ofis mar Joneno mag Jehova kama iluongo ni Louviers e piny Faransa mondo otiega kuom dwe achiel e tij loko dhok . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> In recent years the branch has been working very hard to produce several publications in FSL on DVD . <br>
(trg)="85"> Kuom higni , ofisno nosebedo ka timo kinda ahinya mar loso DVD mang’eny mag dho FSL . <br>

<hr>
(src)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
(trg)="88"> Kata obedo ni an kaachiel gi Vanessa ne waneno ni tiyo e ofis mar Joneno ne en migawo makende kendo ni ne en mich moa kuom Jehova Nyasaye , pod ne wawinjo ka waluor matin . <br>

(src)="94"> Would Vanessa find work in the region ? <br>
(trg)="91"> Be Vanessa ne dhi yudo tich e alworano ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
(trg)="92"> Jehova ne oloyonwa pekgo duto e yo maber miwuoro . <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>
(trg)="93"> Ne aneno gi wang’a kaka Jehova ne oherowa gadier kendo kaka ohero joma rodin . <br>

(src)="97"> Having been involved in translation work , I can better understand all that is done to provide spiritual help for the deaf . <br>
