(trg)="26"> Why we talk like that ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> In Eden , his argument was that each individual can and should decide what is good and what is bad , doing so independent of God . <br>
(trg)="27"> For garden of Eden , Satan talk sey we no need God to tell us wetin good and wetin bad . <br>
