(trg)="2"> “ A hun ngaihtuah zawngin zirtîrtu ni tawh hial âwm in ni . ” ​ — HEBRAI 5 : 12 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Why might the words of Hebrews 5 : 12 naturally cause a Christian to feel some measure of concern ? <br>
(trg)="3"> Engvângin nge Hebrai 5 : 12 thu hian Kristiante chu a rûka a tihmangan ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> AS YOU read the inspired words of our theme text , do you feel a measure of concern about yourself ? <br>

<hr>
(src)="5"> If so , you are not alone . <br>
(trg)="5"> I nei a nih pawhin i mal lo ve . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> As followers of Christ , we know that we must be teachers . <br>
(trg)="6"> Krista hnungzuitute kan nih angin , zirtîrtu kan ni tûr a ni tih chu kan hre tlâng a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> We know that the times in which we live make it urgent that we teach as well as we can . <br>
(trg)="7"> ( Matthaia 28 : ​ 19 , 20 ) Kan chênna tûn lai khawvêl hian kan thiam ang tâwka zirtîr chu hmanhmawh thlâk tak a nihtîr a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> And we know that our teaching can even make a life - or - death difference to those whom we teach ! <br>
(trg)="8"> Tin , kan zirtîrna chuan kan zirtîrte thihna emaw , nunna emaw a thlen thei tih kan hre bawk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Naturally , then , we may ask ourselves : ‘ Am I really the teacher I ought to be ? <br>
(trg)="9"> ( 1 Timothea 4 : 16 ) Chuvângin , ‘ Ka nih tûr ang zirtîrtu kan ni tak zet em ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> How can I improve ? ’ <br>

(trg)="12"> 2 , 3 . ( a ) Engtin nge zirtîrtu pakhatin zirtîrna ṭha nghahchhan a sawifiah ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> ( b ) Jesus set what pattern for us as to teaching ? <br>
(trg)="13"> ( b ) Zirtîrna chungchângah Isua’n eng nge min tihhmuh ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Such concerns need not discourage us . <br>
(trg)="14"> Chûng manganna chuan min tilunghnual tûr a ni lo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> If we think of teaching solely in terms of some studied techniques , we might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of making improvements . <br>
(trg)="15"> Zirtîrna chu thiam thil engemaw bîk riau neih ngai nia kan ngaih chuan , hma sâwn chu thil harsa tak niah kan ngai mai ang . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> The foundation of good teaching , though , is not technique but something far more important . <br>
(trg)="16"> Nimahsela , zirtîrna ṭha chu a tih dân kalhmang hriat ringawtah a innghat lo va , chu aia thil pawimawh daih zâwkah a innghat a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Note what one experienced teacher wrote in a book on the subject : “ Good teaching is not a matter of specific techniques or styles , plans or actions . . . . <br>
(trg)="17"> He mi chungchângah hun rei tak zirtîrtu lo nih tawh mi pakhat thusawi hi chhinchhiah teh : “ Zirtîrna ṭha chu tih dân phung engemaw bîk leh thiamna engemaw bîk ; ruahmanna leh thiltih ringawtah a innghat lo . . . . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Teaching is primarily a matter of love . ” <br>
(trg)="18"> Zirtîrna kawnga thil pawimawh ber chu hmangaihna a ni , ” tih hi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> Of course , his perspective was that of a secular teacher . <br>
(trg)="19"> Ani sawi hi chu lehkha zirna lama zirtîrtu chungchâng a ni ngei mai a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Still , his point may be even more applicable to the teaching we do as Christians . <br>
(trg)="20"> Nimahsela , a thusawi hi Kristian inzirtîrna kawngah pawh a hman tlâk zâwk mah mai thei a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> How so ? <br>
(trg)="21"> Engtin nge ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Our Exemplar of a teacher is none other than Jesus Christ , who told his followers : “ I set the pattern for you . ” <br>
(trg)="22"> Kan tâna zirtîrtu Entawn tûr chu tu dang ni lovin , a zirtîrte hnêna “ Ka tihhmuh che u , ” titu Isua Krista hi a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> He was referring to his example in showing humility , but the pattern Jesus set for us certainly includes his principal work as a man on earth ​ — that of teaching people the good news of God’s Kingdom . <br>
(trg)="23"> ( Johana 13 : 15 ) Inngaihtlâwmna lantîr kawnga a entawn tûr siam chungchâng a sawina ni mah se , kan tâna Isua entawn tûr siamte zîngah chuan he leia mihringa a awm laia a hna thawh pawimawh ber ​ — Pathian Ram chanchin ṭha mite hnêna hrilh chu a tel ngei a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Now , if you had to choose a single word to characterize Jesus ’ ministry , you would likely select the word “ love , ” would you not ? <br>
(trg)="24"> ( Luka 4 : 43 ) Chu mi avâng chuan , Isua rawngbâwlna sawifiah nân thu mal pakhat chauh thlang dâwn ta la , “ hmangaihna ” tih thu mal i thlang mai lo’ng maw ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> Jesus ’ love for his heavenly Father , Jehovah , was paramount . <br>
(trg)="25"> ( Kolossa 1 : 15 ; 1 Johana 4 :⁠ 8 ) Isua’n a Pa Jehova a hmangaihna chu a sâng ber a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> As a teacher , though , Jesus manifested love in two additional ways . <br>
(trg)="26"> ( Johana 14 : 31 ) Nimahsela , zirtîrtu a nih angin Isua chuan hmangaihna chu kawng dang chi hnihin a lantîr bawk a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> He loved the truths he taught , and he loved the people he taught . <br>
(trg)="27"> Ani chuan thutak a zirtîr chu a hmangaih a ; tin , mi a zirtîrna dawngtute pawh a hmangaih bawk a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Let us focus more closely on these two aspects of the pattern he set for us . <br>
(trg)="28"> He kawng chi hniha Isua min tihhmuh hi ngun lehzualin i lo bih chiang ang u . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> A Long - Standing Love of Divine Truths <br>
(trg)="29"> Pathian Thutak Hmangaihna Kumhlun <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> How did Jesus form a love for Jehovah’s teachings ? <br>
(trg)="30"> Engtin nge Isua’n Jehova zirtîrnate hmangaihna a neih chhoh ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> A teacher’s attitude toward his subject has a considerable bearing on the quality of his teaching . <br>

(trg)="32"> A thu zirtîra tuina a neih loh chuan zirlaite chungah a lo lang mai ṭhîn . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Jesus felt no apathy toward the precious truths he taught about Jehovah and His Kingdom . <br>
(trg)="33"> Isua chuan Jehova leh A Lalram chungchâng a thutak zirtîr hlu êm êm mai chu a tuipui hle a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Jesus ’ love for this subject was profound . <br>
(trg)="34"> Chu thu a hmangaihna chu a thûk hle a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> He had formed that love as a student . <br>
(trg)="35"> Chu hmangaihna chu zirlai a nih aṭangin a nei a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Throughout the long ages of his prehuman existence , the only - begotten Son was an avid learner . <br>
(trg)="36"> Mihringa a lo chan hma hun rei tak chhûng zawng khân , Fapa mal neihchhun chu zirlai taima tak a ni ṭhîn a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Isaiah 50 : 4 , 5 records these fitting words : “ The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has given me the tongue of the taught ones , that I may know how to answer the tired one with a word . <br>
(src)="37"> He awakens morning by morning ; he awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones . <br>
(trg)="37"> Isaia 50 : ​ 4 , 5 chuan a tâna thu inchawih tak hi a chhinchhiah a ni : “ Mi hah tak chu thu - a ka tihhahdam thiam nân Lalpa PATHIAN chuan zirtîrte lei mi pe a ; ani chuan atûk atûk tin a kaiharh a , zirtîrten an hriat anga hre tûrin ka beng hi [ a ] kai harh ṭhîn . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear , and I , for my part , was not rebellious . <br>
(src)="39"> I did not turn in the opposite direction . ” <br>
(trg)="38"> Lalpa PATHIAN chuan ka beng mi tihâwngsak a , kei chu ka hel lo va , ka hawi kîr hek lo , ” tiin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> 5 , 6 . ( a ) What experience did Jesus evidently have at his baptism , with what effect upon him ? <br>
(trg)="39"> 5 , 6 . ( a ) Isua’n baptisma a chan khân eng thil nge a tawn a , chu chuan engtin nge amah a nghawng ? <br>
<hr>

(trg)="40"> ( b ) Pathian Thu hman dân chungchângah Isua leh Setana danglamna eng nge kan hmuh ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> While growing up as a human on earth , Jesus continued to love divine wisdom . <br>
(trg)="41"> Mihring anga he leia a ṭhanlen pawh khân , Isua chuan Pathian finna a hmangaih zawm zêl a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Then , at the time of his baptism , he went through a unique experience . <br>
(trg)="42"> ( Luka 2 : 52 ) Tichuan , baptisma a chan hunah , thiltawn ropui tak a tawng a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> “ The heaven was opened up , ” says Luke 3 : 21 . <br>
(trg)="43"> Luka 3 : 21 chuan “ vân a lo inhawng a , ” a ti . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Evidently , Jesus was then able to recall his prehuman existence . <br>
(trg)="44"> A lan dânin , chuta ṭang chuan Isua chuan mihring a nih hmaa a dinhmun zawng zawng chu a hrechhuakleh thei ta a ni . <br>

(src)="46"> Thereafter he spent 40 days fasting in the wilderness . <br>
(trg)="45"> Chu mi hnu chuan thlalêrah ni 40 chhûng chaw ngheiin a awm a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> He must have found intense delight in meditating on the many heavenly sessions of instruction he had received from Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="46"> Vâna a awm laia Jehova hnên aṭanga kaihhruaina a dawnte ngaihtuah chu a tuipui tak zet ngei ang . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Before long , though , his love of God’s truths was put to the test . <br>
(trg)="47"> Mahse , rei lo têah Pathian thutak a hmangaihna chu fiah a ni ta thuai a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> When Jesus was fatigued and hungry , Satan sought to tempt him . <br>
(trg)="48"> Isua chu chau tak leh rilṭâm taka a awm laiin , Setana chuan thlêm a tum ta a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> What a contrast we find between these two sons of God ! <br>
(trg)="49"> Hêng Pathian fapa pahnihte hi an va inang lo êm ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Both quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures ​ — but with a completely different spirit . <br>
(trg)="50"> An pahnih chuan Hebrai Pathian Lehkha Thu an ṭanchhan ve ve a ​ — mahse , rilru dang daih an pu ve ve a ni . <br>

(trg)="51"> Setana chuan Pathian Thu chu ama duhthusâm tihfamkim nân zah lo takin a la kawi a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Really , that rebel had nothing but contempt for divine truths . <br>
(trg)="52"> Chu hel hmangpa chuan Pathian thutak chu a hmusit tak zet a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> On the other hand , Jesus quoted the Scriptures with obvious love , using God’s Word carefully in each reply . <br>
(trg)="53"> Isua erawh chuan Pathian Lehkha Thu chu a chhân lêtna tinah ngun taka hmangin , hmangaihna nên a hmang a ni tih a chiang hle thung . <br>

(trg)="54"> Isua chu chûng thâwk khum thute ziah chhuah a nih hma rei takah lo awm tawh mah se , chûng chu a zah êm êm tho a ni . <br>

(src)="56"> They were precious truths from his heavenly Father ! <br>
(trg)="55"> Chûng thute chu vâna a Pa hnên aṭanga lo chhuak thutak a ni tlat si a ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> He told Satan that such words from Jehovah were more vital than food . <br>
(trg)="56"> Jehova hnên aṭanga lo kal chûng thute chu chaw aiin a pawimawh zâwkzia Setana chu a hrilh a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Yes , Jesus loved all the truths that Jehovah had taught him . <br>
(trg)="57"> ( Matthaia 4 : ​ 1 - 11 ) Ni e , Isua chuan Jehova thutak zirtîr zawng zawng chu a hmangaih a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> How , though , did he display that love as a teacher ? <br>
(trg)="58"> A nih leh zirtîrtu a nih angin engtin nge chu a hmangaihna chu a târ lan ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Love for the Truths He Taught <br>
(trg)="59"> A Thutak Zirtîr A Hmangaihna <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Why did Jesus refrain from inventing his own teachings ? <br>
(trg)="60"> Engvângin nge Isua chuan ama ngaih dân zirtîr chu a pumpelh ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Jesus ’ love for the truths he taught was always apparent . <br>
(trg)="61"> Isua’n thutak a zirtîr a , chu thutak a hmangaihzia chu engtik lai pawhin a lang chiang a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> After all , he might easily have developed his own ideas . <br>
(src)="64"> He possessed a vast repository of knowledge and wisdom . <br>
(trg)="62"> Hriatna leh finna nasa tak a neih avângin , ama ngaih dân rawlh tel mai pawh thil awlsam tak a ni ngei ang . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> Nevertheless , he reminded his listeners again and again that everything he taught originated , not with himself , but with his heavenly Father . <br>
(trg)="63"> ( Kolossa 2 : ​ 2 , 3 ) Nimahsela , a thu zirtîrte chu amah aṭanga chhuak ni lovin , vâna a Pa hnên aṭanga chhuak a nih thu a thu ngaithlatute chu a hriatnawntîr reng a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> He loved divine truths far too much to replace them with his own thinking . <br>
(trg)="64"> ( Johana 7 : 16 ; 8 : 28 ; 12 : 49 ; 14 : 10 ) Pathian thutak chu a hmangaih êm avângin ama ngaih dân nên a thlâk thleng thei lo a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> At the start of his ministry , how did Jesus set a pattern of relying on God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="65"> A rawng bâwlna a ṭan aṭangin , engtin nge Isua chuan Pathian Thu rinchhanna chungchângah entawn tûr a siam ? <br>

(trg)="66"> Isua chuan vântlânga a rawngbâwlna a ṭan phat aṭangin , entawn tûr a tihhmuh nghâl a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> Consider the way he first declared to God’s people that he was the promised Messiah . <br>
(trg)="67"> Messia lo awm tûra sawi lâwka kha amah a nihzia Pathian mite hnêna a puanchhuah hmasak ber dân kha ngaihtuah teh . <br>

(src)="70"> Did he simply appear before crowds , proclaim himself Christ , and then perform spectacular miracles to prove his point ? <br>
(trg)="68"> Mipui hmaah dingin , Krista a nihzia a inpuan hnuah , chu a thusawi chu a dikzia târ lan nân mite hmuhah thilmak a ti nghâl mai em ni ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> No . <br>

(src)="72"> He went to a synagogue , where God’s people habitually read from the Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="70"> Pathian mite’n Pathian Lehkha Thu an chhiarna hmun inkhâwmna inah a kal a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> There he read aloud the prophecy of Isaiah 61 : 1 , 2 and explained that these prophetic truths applied to him . <br>
(trg)="71"> Chutah chuan Isaia 61 : ​ 1 , 2 - a hrilh lâwk thu chu a chhiar a , chu hrilh lâwk thu thutak chu amahah a thlen famkimzia a hrilhfiah a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> His many miracles helped to establish that he had Jehovah’s backing . <br>
(trg)="72"> ( Luka 4 : ​ 16 - 22 ) A thilmak tih tam tak chuan Jehova ṭanpuina a neihzia a târ lang a . <br>

(src)="75"> Still , he always relied on God’s Word in his teaching . <br>
(trg)="73"> Chuti chung chuan , a zirtîrnaah Pathian Thu a rinchhan tlat a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> In his dealings with the Pharisees , how did Jesus show his loyal love for God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="74"> Pharisaite a dâwrnaah , engtin nge Isua chuan Pathian Thu a hmangaih nghehzia a târ lan ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> When Jesus was challenged by religious opponents , he did not engage them in a duel of wits , although he could easily have outdone them in such a contest . <br>
(trg)="75"> Amah kalhtu sakhaw hruaitute a hmachhawn hunah pawh , Isua chuan a finna leh thiamna hmangin awlsam taka hneh thei tûr ni mah se , chutianga tih chu a tum lo va . <br>

(src)="78"> Rather , he let God’s Word refute them . <br>
(trg)="76"> Chutih ahnêkin , an dik lohzia chu Pathian Thu hmangin a hailang zâwk a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> Recall , for instance , when the Pharisees charged that Jesus ’ followers had violated the Sabbath law by plucking a few heads of grain in a field and eating them while passing through . <br>
(trg)="77"> Entîr nân , Sabbath nîa Isua hnungzuitute’n lova buhvui thliaka an ei a , chu mi avânga Pharisaite’n Sabbath dân bawhchhia nia an puh ṭum kha han ngaihtuah kîr ta la . <br>

(trg)="78"> Isua chuan : “ Davida a rilṭâm laia a ṭhiante nêna an thil tih kha in chhiar lo vem ni ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> Of course , those self - righteous men may well have read that inspired account recorded at 1 Samuel 21 : 1 - 6 . <br>

(trg)="81"> An chhiar a nih chuan , zir tûr pawimawh tak a ken tel chu an hre thiam lo a ni . <br>

(src)="83"> Jesus , however , had done more than read the account . <br>

(trg)="84"> Chu thuziak hmanga Jehova zirtîr thu bulte chu a hmangaih a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> So he used that account , as well as an example from the Mosaic Law , to reveal the balanced spirit of the Law . <br>
(trg)="85"> Chuvângin , Dân thu chu a khirh bur lohzia târ lan nân , chu thuziak leh Mosia Dân aṭanga entîrna dang chu a hmang a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> Similarly , Jesus ’ loyal love moved him to defend God’s Word against the efforts of religious leaders to twist it to their own ends or bury it under a morass of human traditions . <br>

(trg)="87"> Engtin nge Isua’n zirtîr thiamna chungchânga hrilh lâwk thu chu a tihthlen famkim ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> Jesus ’ love of his subject would never allow him to teach merely by rote , in a manner that was tired or mechanical . <br>
(trg)="88"> A thutak zirtîr a hmangaihna chuan Isua chu nin hmêl tak emaw , mihring mize tel lo emawa ngaihtuah lêm lovin thu a sawitîr ngai lo va . <br>

(trg)="93"> Engvângin nge a zirtîr thiamna chuan Isua chu a chapotîr ngai loh ? <br>
