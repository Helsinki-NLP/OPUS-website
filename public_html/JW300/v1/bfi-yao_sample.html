(trg)="48"> Ŵandu ŵane akusakulupilila kuti ŵandu 72 ni ŵaŵagopolele Baibuloji . <br>

(trg)="54"> 19 : 20 ; 20 : 16 ; Mase . <br>

<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(src)="47"> However , he also knew the ancient Hebrew of Moses and the prophets , which was read each week in the synagogues . <br>

(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>

(trg)="61"> Ciklistu pacawandile , ligongo cici ŵandu ŵa Mlungu ŵakamulicisyaga masengo mnope Cigiliki , soni ana yeleyi yikulosya cici pakwamba ya Yehofa ? <br>

(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>
(trg)="63"> ( Aŵalanje Masengo 6 : 1 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="64"> Ciklistu pacawandile , Aklistu ŵaŵecetanaga mnope Cigiliki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="65"> Mabuku ga Ngani Syambone ga Matayo , Maliko , Luka , ni Yohane gagakusasala yaŵajiganyisye Yesu , ŵagawandisyaga mu Cigiliki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Thus , the language of many disciples was Greek rather than Hebrew . <br>
(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="66"> Yeleyi yikulosya kuti ŵakulijiganya ŵa Yesu ŵajinji ŵakamulicisyaga masengo Cigiliki ngaŵaga Cihebeli . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(trg)="67"> * Yikalata ya ndumetume Paulo soni mabuku gane ga m’Baibulo ŵayilembile m’Cigiliki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> What does this indicate about Jehovah ? <br>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="68"> Yili yakutesya lung’wanu kuti ŵaŵalembaga Malemba Gacigiliki Gaciklistu ŵakamulaga maloŵe m’Malemba Gacihebeli , mnopemnope ŵajigalaga mu Baibulo ja Septuagint . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> These quotations , which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording , are now part of the inspired Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="69"> Atamose kuti Malembaga pane gakusalekangana panandi ni ga Cihebeli candanda , nambo sambano gali mbali ja Malemba gagasaliligwe ni Mlungu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="70"> M’yoyo , masengo ga ŵandu ŵangali umlama gali mbali ja Maloŵe ga Mlungu jwangakusanonyela mtundu kapena ciŵeceto cimo kupunda cijakwe . ​ — Aŵalanje Masengo 10 : 34 . <br>

(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="71"> Ana tukulijiganya cici pa mwaŵaŵecetanilaga Yehofa ni ŵandu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Our brief review of God’s communication with humans teaches us that Jehovah communicates according to need and circumstances . <br>
(trg)="72"> Tulijiganyisye kuti Yehofa akusaŵecetana ni ŵandu mwakamulana ni mwayiŵelele yindu pandaŵijo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>
(trg)="73"> Yehofa ngakusatukanganicisya kuti tulijiganye ciŵeceto cinecakwe pakusaka kuti tummanyilile jwalakwe soni lisosa lyakwe . <br>

(trg)="74"> ( Aŵalanje Zekariya 8 : 23 ; Ciunukuko 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>

(trg)="88"> M’yaka ya m’ma 1500 C.E . , William Tyndale ŵatandite kugopolela Baibulo m’Cisungu . <br>
