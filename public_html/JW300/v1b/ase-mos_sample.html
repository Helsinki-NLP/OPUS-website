(trg)="2"> “ Yãmb da tog n yɩɩ karen - saam dãmb hal daar zãra . ” — HEBRE DÃMBA 5 : 12 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Why might the words of Hebrews 5 : 12 naturally cause a Christian to feel some measure of concern ? <br>
(trg)="3"> Bõe yĩng tɩ goam nins sẽn be Hebre dãmba 5 : 12 pʋgẽ wã tõe n kɩt tɩ kiris - ned tags tɩ pak - a lame ? <br>

(trg)="4"> YÃMB sẽn karem verse yẽgrã vʋʋsem sõng sẽn vẽneg tɩ b gʋlsã , y pa ne tɩ pak - y lame sɩda ? <br>

(src)="5"> If so , you are not alone . <br>

(src)="6"> As followers of Christ , we know that we must be teachers . <br>
(trg)="6"> D sẽn yaa Kirist karen - biisã , d miime tɩ d segd n yɩɩ karen - saam dãmba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> We know that the times in which we live make it urgent that we teach as well as we can . <br>

(trg)="8"> La d miime tɩ tõnd zãmsgã yaa yõor yell n kõ neb nins d sẽn zãmsdã ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Naturally , then , we may ask ourselves : ‘ Am I really the teacher I ought to be ? <br>
(trg)="9"> ( 1 Tɩmote 4 : 16 ) Rẽnd wa sẽn zemse , d tõe n sʋka d menga : ‘ Mam yaa karen - saamb wa sẽn segdã bɩ ? <br>

<hr>
(src)="13"> Such concerns need not discourage us . <br>
(trg)="13"> Yel - kãensã sẽn pak tõndã pa segd n sãam d sũur ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> If we think of teaching solely in terms of some studied techniques , we might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of making improvements . <br>
(trg)="14"> D sã n ges d zãmsgã wa bũmb sẽn tũud ne manesem sẽn yaa toor zall wʋsgo , d tõe n wa tagsame tɩ d pa tõe n paas d zãmsgã sõmblem ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> The foundation of good teaching , though , is not technique but something far more important . <br>
(trg)="15"> La karen - saamd sẽn yaa sõma pa tũud ne zãmsg na - kẽndr bal ye , la a tũuda ne bũmb yõod sẽn yɩɩd woto zĩig sẽn zãra . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Note what one experienced teacher wrote in a book on the subject : “ Good teaching is not a matter of specific techniques or styles , plans or actions . . . . <br>
(trg)="16"> Kelg - y karen - saamb a ye sẽn tar minim sẽn yeel bũmb ning rẽ wɛɛngẽ sebr a ye pʋgẽ to - to : “ Karen - saamd sẽn yaa sõma pa tik manesem takɩ zugu , bɩ na - kẽndr sẽn yaa toor zall zug ye . . . . <br>

(src)="18"> Of course , his perspective was that of a secular teacher . <br>
(trg)="18"> Yaa sɩd t’a ra gomda dũniyã pʋgẽ karen - saamd yelle . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Still , his point may be even more applicable to the teaching we do as Christians . <br>
(trg)="19"> La baasgo , a sẽn togsã tõe n paka tõnd sẽn yaa kiris - neb sẽn karemd neb a taabã n yɩɩd menga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> How so ? <br>
(trg)="20"> Wãn to ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Our Exemplar of a teacher is none other than Jesus Christ , who told his followers : “ I set the pattern for you . ” <br>
(trg)="21"> Sẽn kõ - a tõnd mak sõng karen - saamdã wɛɛngẽ wã pa ned a to n zʋʋg a Zezi Kirist ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> He was referring to his example in showing humility , but the pattern Jesus set for us certainly includes his principal work as a man on earth ​ — that of teaching people the good news of God’s Kingdom . <br>
(trg)="22"> A yeela a karen - biisã : ‘ Mam kõo yãmb mamsgo . ’ <br>
(trg)="23"> ( Zã 13 : 15 ) A ra gomda mamsg ning a sẽn kõ tõnd sik - m - mengã tallg wɛɛngẽ wã yelle . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Now , if you had to choose a single word to characterize Jesus ’ ministry , you would likely select the word “ love , ” would you not ? <br>
(trg)="24"> La a Zezi sẽn zãms nebã Wẽnnaam Rĩungã koe - noogã sẽn yaa tʋʋm kãseng ning a sẽn pids tẽng zugã bee mamsg ning a sẽn bas tõnd yĩngã sʋka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> Jesus ’ love for his heavenly Father , Jehovah , was paramount . <br>

(trg)="26"> Bɩ bõe ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> As a teacher , though , Jesus manifested love in two additional ways . <br>
(trg)="28"> ( Zã 14 : 31 ) La a Zezi sẽn da yaa karen - saambã , a talla nonglem ne manesem a yiib me n paase . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> He loved the truths he taught , and he loved the people he taught . <br>
(trg)="29"> A ra nonga sɩd nins a sẽn zãms nebã , la a ra nonga nebã a sẽn da zãmsdã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Let us focus more closely on these two aspects of the pattern he set for us . <br>
(trg)="30"> Bɩ d ges mak - sõng kãngã nens a yiibã neere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> A Long - Standing Love of Divine Truths <br>

<hr>
(src)="29"> How did Jesus form a love for Jehovah’s teachings ? <br>
(trg)="32"> Wãn to la a Zezi wa n tall nonglem ne a Zeova zãmsgã ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> A teacher’s attitude toward his subject has a considerable bearing on the quality of his teaching . <br>
(trg)="33"> Karen - saamb tagsg ne a sẽn zãmsd bũmb ningã mata a zãmsga sõmblem wʋsgo . <br>

(trg)="34"> Karen - saamba sã n tall yam - kaalgo , na n pukame tɩ karen - biisã me tall yam - kaalg ne a zãmsgã . <br>
<hr>

(trg)="35"> A Zezi pa tall yam - kaalg baa bilf ne sɩd nins sẽn tar yõod a sẽn zãms nebã a Zeova la a Rĩungã wɛɛngẽ wã ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Jesus ’ love for this subject was profound . <br>
(trg)="36"> Nonglem ning a Zezi sẽn da tar ne zãms - kãnga wã ra yaa wʋsgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> He had formed that love as a student . <br>
(trg)="37"> A wa n paama nonglem kãngã , a sẽn wa n zãmsd n bãngdẽ wã sasa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Throughout the long ages of his prehuman existence , the only - begotten Son was an avid learner . <br>
(trg)="38"> Hal sẽn kaoos wʋsgo , nand t’a yɩ ninsaala , Wẽnnaam Biribl a Zezi ra nonga zãmsg wʋsgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Isaiah 50 : 4 , 5 records these fitting words : “ The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has given me the tongue of the taught ones , that I may know how to answer the tired one with a word . <br>
(trg)="39"> Ezai 50 : 4 , 5 tara gom - kãensã sẽn zemsã : “ Zusoab a Wẽnnaam kõo maam gom - minim zelemde tɩ m tõe n bãng goam nins mam sẽn tog n leok ned ninga pãng sẽn sɛ wã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> He awakens morning by morning ; he awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones . <br>
(trg)="40"> Yibeoog fãa , bãmb yokda mam tʋbre tɩ m kelg wa karen - biiga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear , and I , for my part , was not rebellious . <br>
(trg)="41"> Zusoab a Wẽnnaam yoka mam tʋbre , la mam ka tõdg ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> I did not turn in the opposite direction . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> Mam ka leb poorẽ ye . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> 5 , 6 . ( a ) What experience did Jesus evidently have at his baptism , with what effect upon him ? <br>
(trg)="43"> 5 , 6 . a ) Yel - bʋg n maan a Zezi a lisgẽ wã vẽenega , la rẽ tẽeg - a - la bõe ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> ( b ) What contrast do we find between Jesus and Satan as to using God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="44"> b ) Welg - bʋg la d ne a Zezi la a Sʋɩtãan sʋka , sã n yaa ne Wẽnnaam Gomdã rɩk - n - tʋm wɛɛngẽ ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> While growing up as a human on earth , Jesus continued to love divine wisdom . <br>
(trg)="45"> A sẽn da wa n yaa ninsaal n be tẽng zug n bɩtẽ wã , a Zezi kell n talla nonglem ne yam ning sẽn yit Wẽnnaam nengẽ wã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Then , at the time of his baptism , he went through a unique experience . <br>
(trg)="46"> ( Luk 2 : 52 ) Rẽ , a lisgã sasa , yel - sãang n maane . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> “ The heaven was opened up , ” says Luke 3 : 21 . <br>
(trg)="47"> “ Yĩngr pakame , ” woto la Luk 3 : 21 yeta . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Evidently , Jesus was then able to recall his prehuman existence . <br>
(trg)="48"> Vẽenega , rẽ masã a Zezi ra tõe n tẽega a vɩɩmã sẽn da ya a soab sẽn deng t’a yɩ ninsaalã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Thereafter he spent 40 days fasting in the wilderness . <br>
(trg)="49"> Rẽ poore , a loee noor dasem 40 weoogã pʋgẽ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> He must have found intense delight in meditating on the many heavenly sessions of instruction he had received from Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="50"> A Zezi sã n da tagsd zãmsg nins a sẽn paam a Zeova nengẽ saasẽ wã zugu , ra kõt - a - la sũ - noog wʋsgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Before long , though , his love of God’s truths was put to the test . <br>
(trg)="51"> La pa kaoos la a nonglmã ne Wẽnnaam sɩdã paam makr ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> When Jesus was fatigued and hungry , Satan sought to tempt him . <br>
(trg)="52"> Yaams la kom sẽn wa n tar a Zezi , a Sʋɩtãan baoome n na n mak - a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> What a contrast we find between these two sons of God ! <br>
(trg)="53"> Ad sɩd yaa welg - kãseng meng n be Wẽnnaam komdibli a yiib kãensã sʋka ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Both quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures ​ — but with a completely different spirit . <br>
(trg)="54"> B yiibã fãa togsa goam sẽn yit Hebre Gʋlsg Sõamyã pʋgẽ , la pa ne yam yɛng baa bilf ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> Satan twisted God’s Word , disrespectfully using it to serve his own selfish ends . <br>
(trg)="55"> A Sʋɩtãan golma Wẽnnaam Gomdã , n tũnug ne - a ne paoogr manesem sẽn na yɩl n pids a meng raabo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Really , that rebel had nothing but contempt for divine truths . <br>
(trg)="56"> Sɩda , tõt kãngã kisa Wẽnnaam sɩdã bala . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> On the other hand , Jesus quoted the Scriptures with obvious love , using God’s Word carefully in each reply . <br>
(trg)="57"> A Zezi yẽ togsa goam sẽn yit Gʋlsg Sõamyã pʋgẽ ne nonglem sẽn yaa vẽenega , n tũnug ne Wẽnnaam Gomdã tɩ zems neer a leokr fãa pʋgẽ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Jesus had been in existence long before those inspired words were first written down , yet he held them in reverence . <br>
(trg)="58"> A Zezi ra bee hal sẽn kaoos wʋsg tɩ b yaool n wa gʋls gom - kãensã vʋʋsem sõngã vẽnegr pʋgẽ . <br>

(src)="56"> They were precious truths from his heavenly Father ! <br>
(trg)="60"> Sɩd kãens sẽn da tar yõod wʋsgã ra yita a saasẽ Ba wã nengẽ ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> He told Satan that such words from Jehovah were more vital than food . <br>
(trg)="61"> A yeela a Sʋɩtãan tɩ gom - kãensã sẽn yit a Zeova nengẽ wã ra tara yõod n yɩɩd rɩɩbo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Yes , Jesus loved all the truths that Jehovah had taught him . <br>
(trg)="62"> ( Matɩe 4 : 1 - 11 ) N - ye , a Zezi ra nonga sɩd nins fãa a Zeova sẽn da zãms - a wã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> How , though , did he display that love as a teacher ? <br>
(trg)="63"> La wãn to la a wilg nonglem kãng a karen - saamdã pʋgẽ ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Love for the Truths He Taught <br>
(trg)="64"> A ra nonga sɩd nins a sẽn zãms nebã <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Why did Jesus refrain from inventing his own teachings ? <br>
(trg)="65"> Bõe yĩng t’a Zezi pa zãms nebã a meng tagsa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Jesus ’ love for the truths he taught was always apparent . <br>
(trg)="66"> Nonglem ning a Zezi sẽn da tar ne sɩd nins a sẽn zãms nebã ra yaa vẽeneg wakat fãa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> After all , he might easily have developed his own ideas . <br>
(trg)="67"> A ra tõẽ - la nana - nana n zãms nebã a meng tagsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He possessed a vast repository of knowledge and wisdom . <br>
(trg)="68"> A ra tara bãngr la yam wʋsgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> Nevertheless , he reminded his listeners again and again that everything he taught originated , not with himself , but with his heavenly Father . <br>
(trg)="69"> ( Kolos rãmba 2 : 3 ) Baasg zãnga , a tẽega a kɛlgdbã n yɩlem naoor wʋsg tɩ bũmb nins fãa yẽ sẽn zãmsd nebã ra pa yit yẽ meng nengẽ ye , la ra ya a saasẽ Ba wã nengẽ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> He loved divine truths far too much to replace them with his own thinking . <br>
(trg)="70"> ( Zã 7 : 16 ; 8 : 28 ; 12 : 49 ; 14 : 10 ) A ra nonga Wẽnnaam sɩdã wʋsg ne a na ledg - a ne a meng tagsgo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> At the start of his ministry , how did Jesus set a pattern of relying on God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="71"> A koe - noogã mooneg sɩngrẽ , yaa wãn to la a Zezi kõ mak - sõng Wẽnnaam Gomdã zug tikr wɛɛngẽ ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> When Jesus began his public ministry , he quickly set a pattern . <br>
(trg)="72"> A Zezi sẽn wa n sɩng a koe - moonegã zãma sʋkã , a yɩɩ tao - tao n kõ mak - sõngo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> Consider the way he first declared to God’s people that he was the promised Messiah . <br>
(trg)="73"> Ges - y a sẽn maan to - to n togs Wẽnnaam nin - buiidã pipi t’a ra yaa Mesi ning b sẽn kãabã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> Did he simply appear before crowds , proclaim himself Christ , and then perform spectacular miracles to prove his point ? <br>
(trg)="74"> A waa kʋʋngã taoor bal n moon tɩ yẽ mengã yaa Kiristã , tɩ rẽ poor bɩ a maan yel - solem bɛd n na n wilg rẽ bɩ ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> No . <br>
(trg)="75"> Ayo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> He went to a synagogue , where God’s people habitually read from the Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="76"> A kẽnga karen - doogẽ , zĩig ning Wẽnnaam nin - buiidã sẽn nong n karemd Gʋlsg Sõamyã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> There he read aloud the prophecy of Isaiah 61 : 1 , 2 and explained that these prophetic truths applied to him . <br>
(trg)="77"> Beenẽ a zẽka a koɛɛg n karem Ezai 61 : 1 , 2 bãngr - gomdã , la a wilg tɩ sɩd kãensã sẽn yaa bãngr - goamã pidsa yẽ zugu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> His many miracles helped to establish that he had Jehovah’s backing . <br>
(trg)="78"> ( Luk 4 : 16 - 22 ) Yel - soalmã wʋsgã a sẽn maana sõngame n wilg t’a Zeova ra bee ne - a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> Still , he always relied on God’s Word in his teaching . <br>
(trg)="79"> Baa ne rẽ fãa , wakat fãa a tika Wẽnnaam Gomdã zug n zãms nebã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> In his dealings with the Pharisees , how did Jesus show his loyal love for God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="80"> A manesmã ne Fariziẽ rãmbã pʋgẽ , wãn to la a Zezi wilg t’a nonga Wẽnnaam Gomdã wakat fãa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> When Jesus was challenged by religious opponents , he did not engage them in a duel of wits , although he could easily have outdone them in such a contest . <br>
(trg)="81"> Tũudmã bɛɛb sã n da kɩɩsd a Zezi , a ra pa baood n na n wilg t’a yam yɩɩd - b lame ye , baa ne a sẽn da tõe nana - nana n gom n lub - b kɩɩs taab a woto pʋgẽ wã . <br>

(trg)="82"> Wall t’a maan woto , a ra basdame tɩ Wẽnnaam Gomdã wilg - b tɩ b ka bʋʋm ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> Recall , for instance , when the Pharisees charged that Jesus ’ followers had violated the Sabbath law by plucking a few heads of grain in a field and eating them while passing through . <br>
(trg)="83"> Wala makre , tẽeg - y wakat ning Fariziẽ rãmbã sẽn da wa n yeel t’a Zezi karen - biisã kɩɩsa Vʋʋsg daarã , b sẽn da wa n pasgd pʋʋgã n yãk ka - zut a wãn n tẽgd n wõbdẽ wã yelle . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Jesus replied : “ Have you not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry ? ” <br>
(trg)="84"> A Zezi leokame : “ Yãmb nan ka karem a Davɩɩd sẽn maan bũmb ninga kom sẽn tar bãmb ne neb nins sẽn be ne bãmba la ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> Of course , those self - righteous men may well have read that inspired account recorded at 1 Samuel 21 : 1 - 6 . <br>
(trg)="85"> ( Matɩe 12 : 1 - 5 ) Sɩda , tõe tɩ Fariziẽ kãensã sẽn da yaa tɩrs b mens nifẽ wã karma kɩbar ning vʋʋsem sõng sẽn vẽneg tɩ b gʋls tɩ be 1 Sãmwɛll 21 : 1 - 6 pʋgẽ wã . <br>

(trg)="86"> Sã n yaa woto , b pa bãng zãms kãseng ning sẽn be be wã yõod ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> Jesus , however , had done more than read the account . <br>
(trg)="87"> La a Zezi maana sẽn yɩɩd a karem kɩbarã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> He had thought about it and taken its message to heart . <br>
(trg)="88"> A tagsa kɩbarã zug n sak a zãmsgã ne a sũur fãa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> He loved the principles that Jehovah taught by means of that passage . <br>
(trg)="89"> A talla nonglem ne no - kãsems nins a Zeova sẽn tũnug ne verse kãensã n taasã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> So he used that account , as well as an example from the Mosaic Law , to reveal the balanced spirit of the Law . <br>
(trg)="90"> Rẽ n so t’a tũnug ne kɩba - kãnga , n paas makr a yembr sẽn yit a Moiiz Tõogã pʋgẽ , n wilg Tõogã sẽn pukd yam sẽn zemsã . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> Similarly , Jesus ’ loyal love moved him to defend God’s Word against the efforts of religious leaders to twist it to their own ends or bury it under a morass of human traditions . <br>
(trg)="91"> Woto me , a Zezi sẽn tall nonglem wakat fãa ne Wẽnnaam Gomdã tus - a lame t’a kɩɩs modgr nins tũudmã taoor dãmb sẽn maan sẽn na yɩl n golm - a b mens nafr yĩngã , bɩ n lud - a ne ninsaalbã rog - n - migs sẽn gĩt nebã . <br>

(trg)="92"> Wãn to la a Zezi pids bãngr - goamã sẽn tɩ loe ne a zãmsgã sõmblem ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> Jesus ’ love of his subject would never allow him to teach merely by rote , in a manner that was tired or mechanical . <br>
(trg)="93"> Nonglem ning a Zezi sẽn da tar ne sɩd ning a sẽn da zãmsd nebã kɩtame t’a pa zãms - a ne rok - m - zugẽ abada , tɩ kõt yam - yiisg ye . <br>

(trg)="94"> Bãngr - goam nins vʋʋsem sõng sẽn vẽneg tɩ b gʋlsã wilgdame tɩ Mesi wã ‘ noor na n goma gom - noodo , ’ n tũnug ne “ goam sẽn be yamleoogo . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Jesus fulfilled those prophecies by keeping his message fresh and alive , using “ winsome words ” as he taught the truths he so loved . <br>
(trg)="95"> ( Yɩɩl Sõamyã 45 : 3 , Sebr Sõngo ; Sɩngre 49 : 21 , NW ) A Zezi pidsa bãngr - gom - kãensã n kɩt t’a koɛɛgã tall yamleoog la a tall pãnga , n tũnug ne ‘ gom - noodo , ’ a sẽn da wa n zãmsd sɩdã a sẽn da nong wʋsgã . <br>

(trg)="96"> ( Luk 4 : 22 ) Sãmbg sẽn ka be , a sẽn da kõt zãmsgã ne yamleoogã ra pukda a nen - wamdã zugu . <br>
