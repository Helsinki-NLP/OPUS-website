(src)="1"> Identifying the Only True God <br>
(trg)="1"> Luksavve Long Trufala God <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> ALMOST as long as humans have existed , they have had many gods . <br>
(trg)="2"> KLOSAP full taem pipol stap long earth , olketa garem planti god . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> There have been so many that it is difficult to put an accurate figure on the number of gods and goddesses worshiped throughout the earth — but it runs into the millions . <br>
(trg)="3"> Staka tumas nao stap gogo hem hard for markem namba long haomas man and woman god nao pipol worshipim evriwea long earth — bat hem kasem planti million . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> Having established that there is a God , we now ask , Which of all the gods worshiped throughout the earth , now and in the past , is the true God ? <br>
(trg)="4"> From iumi savve God hem stap , iumi savve ask , Which wan long evri god wea olketa man worshipim evriwea long earth , long bifor and distaem , hem trufala God ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> That there is only one true God who can be identified as such is clearly stated in the Bible at John 17 : 3 : “ This means everlasting life , their taking in knowledge of you , the only true God , and of the one whom you sent forth , Jesus Christ . ” <br>
(trg)="5"> Long John 17 : 3 Bible showimaot hao wanfala trufala God nomoa stap : “ Diswan nao minim laef olowe , for olketa kasem savve long iu , only trufala God , and long dat wan wea iu sendem kam , Jesus Christ . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> An Identifying Name <br>
(trg)="6"> Wanfala Nem wea Pipol Luksavve <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> It would be reasonable that any god who has personality would need a personal name to distinguish him from other gods with names of their own . <br>
(trg)="7"> Hem stret for eni god wea garem fasin for mas garem nem bilong hemseleva mekem hem difren from olketa nara god wea garem nem bilong olketa seleva . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> It would preferably be a name designated by the god himself , rather than a name coined by his worshipers . <br>
(trg)="8"> Hem bae gud for datfala god garem nem wea hemseleva nao markem , winim wei wea olketa pipol nao nemem hem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> In this regard , however , a very puzzling fact emerges . <br>
(trg)="9"> From diswan , wanfala samting wea mekem man konfius kamap . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> While most well - established religions ascribe personal names to their gods , Jews and mainstream churches of Christendom have failed to identify by a distinctive personal name the god that they worship . <br>
(trg)="10"> Taem planti bigfala religion givim olketa nem long olketa god bilong olketa , olketa Jew and olketa main church bilong Christendom fail for luksavve wanfala spesol nem for god wea olketa worshipim . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Instead , they resort to such titles as Lord , God , Almighty , and Father . <br>
(trg)="11"> Bat olketa go ahed for iusim olketa title olsem Lord , God , Almighty , and Father . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> Writing in the publication Theology , author David Clines stated the following : “ Somewhere between the fifth and the second centuries B.C . a tragic accident befell God : he lost his name . <br>
(trg)="12"> Insaed long pablikeson wea hem raetem Theology , David Clines raet olsem : “ Samwea midolwan mek - faev and mek - tu century B.C . wanfala sorre samting happen long God : nem bilong hem lus . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> More exactly , Jews gave up using God’s personal name Yahweh , and began to refer to Yahweh by various periphrases : God , the Lord , the Name , the Holy One , the Presence , even the Place . <br>
(trg)="13"> Barava nao , olketa Jew lusim wei for iusim nem bilong God , Yahweh , and olketa start for iusim olketa difren title taem olketa storyim Yahweh olsem : God , Lord , Nem , Holy Wan , Wan Wea Stap , and Ples tu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> Even where Yahweh was written in the Biblical text , readers pronounced the name as Adonai . <br>
(trg)="14"> Nomata insaed long olketa Bible text wea olketa raetem Yahweh , olketa man wea read talemaot nem hia olsem Adonai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> With the final fall of the temple , even the rare liturgical occasions when the name was used ceased , and even the knowledge of the pronunciation of the name was forgotten . ” <br>
(trg)="15"> Bihaen lastfala taem wea temple distroe , nomata long spesol taem for worship , olketa no savve hao for talemaot datfala nem bihaen olketa stop for iusim . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> However , no one can say for sure exactly when orthodox Jews ceased to pronounce God’s name out loud and instead substituted the Hebrew words for God and Sovereign Lord . <br>
(trg)="16"> Bat , no eniwan barava savve long taem wea olketa orthodox Jew stop for talemaot big nem bilong God bat iusim olketa narafala Hebrew word for God and Sovereign Lord . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> It seems , then , that the very first essential in any quest to identify “ the only true God ” would be to get to know him by name . <br>
(trg)="17"> Hem luk olsem , firstfala important wei for lukaotem and for luksavve long “ only trufala God ” hem for savve long nem bilong hem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> Such a search is not at all difficult , for the name of Almighty God , the Creator , is clearly and simply stated at Psalm 83 : 18 : “ That men may know that thou , whose name alone is JEHOVAH , art the most high over all the earth . ” — King James Version . <br>
(trg)="18"> Wei for lukaotem God nating hard nomoa , bikos nem bilong Almighty God , Creator , showaot klia long Psalm 83 : 18 : “ Mekem pipol savve hao iu , wea nem bilong iu JEHOVAH , iu nomoa most hae ovarem full earth . ” — King James Version . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Jehovah or Yahweh ? <br>
(trg)="19"> Jehovah or Yahweh ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Whereas the name Jehovah appears in the King James Version and other Bible translations , some prefer to use the name Yahweh instead of Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="20"> From nem bilong Jehovah kamap insaed King James Version and olketa narafala Bible transleison , samfala chus for iusim nem Yahweh winim Jehovah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Which name is correct ? <br>
(trg)="21"> Wanem nem nao stret ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> The most ancient Bible manuscripts were written in the Hebrew language . <br>
(trg)="22"> Olketa raetem planti oldfala copy bilong Bible long Hebrew languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> In the Hebrew Scriptures , the divine name occurs almost 7,000 times and is spelled with four consonants — YHWH or JHVH . <br>
(trg)="23"> Long olketa Hebrew Scripture , nem bilong God kamap klosap 7,000 taem and olketa raetem witim fofala leta — YHWH or JHVH . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> These four - consonant words are commonly called the Tetragrammaton , or Tetragram , derived from two Greek words meaning “ four letters . ” <br>
(trg)="24"> Olketa kolem fofala leta hia Tetragrammaton , or Tetragram , wea kam from tufala Greek word wea minim “ fofala leta . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> Now the question of accurate pronunciation arises because early Hebrew writing consisted of consonants with no vowels to guide the reader . <br>
(trg)="25"> So kwestin abaotem stretfala wei for talemaot kamap from firstfala Hebrew raeting hem garem fofala leta wea no garem olketa vowel for gaedem man wea read . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So whether the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton becomes Yahweh or Jehovah depends on which vowels the reader supplies to the four consonants . <br>
(trg)="26"> So wei for talem Tetragrammaton for kamap Yahweh or Jehovah depend long wanem kaen vowel nao man wea read iusim long fofala leta hia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Today many Hebrew scholars prefer Yahweh as the true pronunciation . <br>
(trg)="27"> Distaem planti Hebrew savveman laekem Yahweh olsem trufala wei for talem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> However , consistency favors Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="28"> Bat planti samting point go long Jehovah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> In what way ? <br>
(trg)="29"> Long wanem wei ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> The pronunciation Jehovah has been accepted in English for centuries . <br>
(trg)="30"> Olketa acceptim wei for talem Jehovah long English for planti handred year nao . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> Those who object to using this pronunciation should also object to the use of the accepted pronunciation Jeremiah and even Jesus . <br>
(trg)="31"> Olketa wea againstim wei for talem disfala nem Jehovah , shud againstim tu wei for talem disfala nem Jeremiah and Jesus . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Jeremiah would need to be changed to Yir·meyahʹ or Yir·meyaʹhu , the original Hebrew pronunciations , and Jesus would become Ye·shuʹaʽ ( Hebrew ) or I·e·sousʹ ( Greek ) . <br>
(trg)="32"> Jeremiah bae savve change long Yir·meyahʹ or Yir·meyaʹhu , firstfala wei for talemaot long Hebrew , and Jesus bae kamap Ye·shuʹaʽ ( long Hebrew ) or I·e·sousʹ ( long Greek ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Hence , many Bible students , including Jehovah’s Witnesses , feel that consistency favors the use of the already well - known English - language “ Jehovah ” and its equivalent in other languages . <br>
(trg)="33"> Dastawe , planti Bible student , insaed long diswan tu Olketa Witness Bilong Jehovah , tingse hao planti samting point go long wei for iusim disfala main English word “ Jehovah ” and semkaen nem long olketa narafala languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> Does It Really Matter ? <br>
(trg)="34"> Waswe , Hem Barava Important ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Some may argue that it does not really matter whether you address Almighty God by a personal name or not , and they are content to speak of and address God as Father or simply as God . <br>
(trg)="35"> Samfala maet sei hao hem no barava important for iu talem nem bilong Almighty God or nomoa , and olketa satisfae for talem nem olsem God or Father taem olketa tok abaotem God . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Both these terms , however , are titles rather than names and are neither personal nor distinctive . <br>
(trg)="36"> Bat , tufala toktok hia , olketa title nomoa and no nem bilong God or olketa spesol nem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> In Bible times the word for God ( ʼElo·himʹ , Hebrew ) was used to describe any god — even the pagan Philistine god named Dagon . <br>
(trg)="37"> Long taem bilong Bible bifor olketa iusim datfala toktok for God ( ʼElo·himʹ , long Hebrew ) taem olketa storyim eni god — and olketa iusim tu for heathen god bilong Philistine , Dagon . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> So for a Hebrew to tell a Philistine that he , the Hebrew , worshiped “ God ” would not have identified the true God whom he worshiped . <br>
(trg)="38"> ( Judges 16 : 23 , 24 ) So for wanfala Hebrew talem wanfala Philistine hao hem , wanfala Hebrew , wea hem worshipim “ God , ” diswan bae no showimaot trufala God wea hem worshipim . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> Of interest is a comment in The Imperial Bible - Dictionary of 1874 : “ [ Jehovah ] is everywhere a proper name , denoting the personal God and him only ; whereas Elohim partakes more of the character of a common noun , denoting usually , indeed , but not necessarily nor uniformly , the Supreme . . . . <br>
(trg)="39"> Wanfala interesting toktok insaed The Imperial Bible - Dictionary bilong 1874 hem sei : “ Evriwea [ Jehovah ] hem nem bilong samwan wea point go long God wea laef and hem nomoa ; long narasaed Elohim hem join moa witim samting wea fitim eniting , wea planti taem storyim Most Hae God , bat no evritaem . . . . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> The Hebrew may say the Elohim , the true God , in opposition to all false gods ; but he never says the Jehovah , for Jehovah is the name of the true God only . <br>
(trg)="40"> Hebrew man maet sei datfala Elohim , datfala tru God , wea againstim evri giaman god ; bat hem nating sei datfala Jehovah , from Jehovah hem nem bilong tru God nomoa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> He says again and again my God . . . ; but never my Jehovah , for when he says my God , he means Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="41"> Planti taem hem sei God bilong mi . . . ; bat hem nating sei Jehovah bilong mi , from taem hem sei God bilong mi , hem minim Jehovah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> He speaks of the God of Israel , but never of the Jehovah of Israel , for there is no other Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="42"> Hem savve tok abaotem God bilong Israel , bat no abaotem Jehovah bilong Israel , from no eni nara Jehovah stap . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> He speaks of the living God , but never of the living Jehovah , for he cannot conceive of Jehovah as other than living . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> Hem tok abaotem God wea laef , bat no abaotem Jehovah wea laef , from hem nating savve tingim Jehovah olsem hem no laef . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> The True God’s Qualities <br>
(trg)="44"> Olketa Fasin Bilong Trufala God <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Just knowing someone’s name , of course , does not mean that we know him or her in any depth . <br>
(trg)="45"> For savve long nem bilong samwan , hem no minim iumi barava savve gud long hem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> The majority of us know the names of leading politicians . <br>
(trg)="46"> Staka long iumi savve long nem bilong olketa leader long gavman . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> Even prominent men and women in other countries may have names that are well - known to us . <br>
(trg)="47"> Iumi savve long nem bilong samfala important man and woman bilong narafala kantri tu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> But simply knowing their names — even how to pronounce them correctly — does not in itself mean that we know these people personally or know what kind of people they are . <br>
(trg)="48"> Bat for savve long olketa nem nomoa — nomata for talem long stretfala wei — hem no minim iumi barava savve gud long datfala man or woman or barava savve gud wanem kaen man or woman nao olketa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> Similarly , to know the only true God , we need to get to know and admire his qualities . <br>
(trg)="49"> Olsem tu , for savve long only trufala God , iumi need for trae for savve and barava laekem fasin bilong hem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Though it is true that humans will never be able to see the true God , he has kindly had recorded for us in the Bible many details about his personality . <br>
(trg)="50"> Nomata hem tru hao olketa man bae no savve lukim trufala God , long kaenfala wei hem putim record abaotem fasin bilong hem for iumi insaed long Bible . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Certain Hebrew prophets were given inspired visions of Almighty God’s heavenly courts . <br>
(trg)="51"> ( Exodus 33 : 20 ; John 1 : 18 ) Samfala Hebrew profet lukim vision abaotem kot bilong Almighty God long heven . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> What they describe portrays not only great dignity and awesome majesty and power but also serenity , order , beauty , and pleasantness . — Exodus 24 : 9 - 11 ; Isaiah 6 : 1 ; Ezekiel 1 : 26 - 28 ; Daniel 7 : 9 ; Revelation 4 : 1 - 3 . <br>
(trg)="52"> Wanem olketa storyim no showim nomoa bigfala honor and spesol glory and paoa bat tu peace , order , luk naes and barava gud . — Exodus 24 : 9 - 11 ; Isaiah 6 : 1 ; Ezekiel 1 : 26 - 28 ; Daniel 7 : 9 ; Revelation 4 : 1 - 3 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Jehovah God outlined some of his attractive and appealing qualities to Moses , as recorded at Exodus 34 : 6 , 7 : “ Jehovah , Jehovah , a God merciful and gracious , slow to anger and abundant in loving - kindness and truth , preserving loving - kindness for thousands , pardoning error and transgression and sin . ” <br>
(trg)="53"> Jehovah God showimaot olketa naesfala fasin bilong hem wea muvim Moses , olsem hem stap long Exodus 34 : 6 , 7 : “ Jehovah , Jehovah , God wea garem mercy and kaenfala fasin , slow for kros and garem bigfala loving - kaeness and truth , keepim loving - kaeness for olketa thousand , forgivim mistek and rong and sin . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> Don’t you agree that getting to know about these qualities of God draws us to him and makes us want to know more about him as a person ? <br>
(trg)="54"> Waswe , iu no agree hao wei for kasem savve abaotem olketa fasin bilong God savve pullim iumi for kam klosap long hem and mekem iumi for laek savve planti samting moa abaotem hem ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> While no human will ever be able to see Jehovah God in his resplendent glory , it is recorded that when Jesus Christ was a man on earth , he actually reflected the type of person that Jehovah God , his heavenly Father , is . <br>
(trg)="55"> Nomata no eniwan fit for lukim Jehovah God long nambawan glory bilong hem , Bible storyim hao taem Jesus Christ stap long earth , hem barava showimaot wanem kaen man nao Dadi bilong hem long heven , Jehovah God . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> On one occasion Jesus said : “ The Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative , but only what he beholds the Father doing . <br>
(trg)="56"> Wanfala taem Jesus sei : “ Son no savve duim eni samting followim tingting bilong hemseleva , bat only samting wea hem lukim Father hem duim . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> For whatever things that One does , these things the Son also does in like manner . ” — John 5 : 19 . <br>
(trg)="57"> From eni samting wea dat Wan hem duim , Son hem duim olketa samting hia long sem wei tu . ” — John 5 : 19 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> So we can deduce from this that Jesus ’ kindness , compassion , mildness , and warmth as well as his strong love for righteousness and hatred of wickedness are all qualities that Jesus observed in his Father , Jehovah God , while Jesus was with him in the heavenly courts before becoming a man on earth . <br>
(trg)="58"> So iumi savve sure wei wea Jesus showimaot kaenfala fasin , fasin for care , kwaet fasin , naesfala feeling witim strongfala fasin for lovem raeteous fasin and heitim nogud fasin , evri fasin hia nao samting wea hem lukim long Dadi bilong hem , Jehovah God , taem hem stap witim God long heven bifor hem kamap man long earth . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> Thus , when we truly come to know with understanding the full meaning of the name Jehovah , we surely have every reason to love and bless that sacred name , to praise and exalt it , and to trust in it . <br>
(trg)="59"> Dastawe , taem iumi barava kasem and savve long mining long nem bilong Jehovah , iumi barava garem evri reason for lovem and blessim datfala holy nem , for praisem and mekhae long hem and trustim hem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Getting to know the only true God in this way is really a never - ending process , as is brought out clearly in the rendering of John 17 : 3 in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="60"> For savve long only trufala God long disfala wei hem samting wea no savve kasem end , olsem Bible talemaot klia long John 17 : 3 long New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Here the correct tense of the verb “ to know ” helps greatly , for the present continuous tense is used rather than the simple present tense . <br>
(trg)="61"> Long hia stretfala mining bilong disfala verb “ for savve ” hem barava helpem iumi , from hem iusim for samting wea go ahed for happen distaem and no for samting wea happen distaem nomoa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Hence , we read : “ This means everlasting life , their taking in knowledge of you , the only true God , and of the one whom you sent forth , Jesus Christ . ” <br>
(trg)="62"> Dastawe , iumi read olsem : “ Diswan nao minim laef olowe , for olketa kasem savve long iu , only trufala God , and long dat wan wea iu sendem kam , Jesus Christ . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Yes , continuing to take in knowledge of the only true God , Jehovah , and of his Son , Jesus Christ , is a process that should never end . <br>
(trg)="63"> Tru nao , for go ahed kasem savve long only trufala God , Jehovah , and long Son bilong hem , Jesus Christ , hem samting wea shud no stop . <br>
