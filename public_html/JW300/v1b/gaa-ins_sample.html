(trg)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> Mɔ ni gba ji Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Yɛ afi 1975 mli lɛ , no mli lɛ miye afii enyɔ , ni no beaŋ mimami yɔse akɛ nɔ ko eyaaa lɛ jogbaŋŋ yɛ migbɛfaŋ . <br>
(trg)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> Mimami hiɛ mi yɛ edɛŋ beni enaanyo ko ŋmɛɛ nɔ ko ni tsĩi jogbaŋŋ he etswa shi , ni egbɛɛ waa diɛŋtsɛ . <br>
(trg)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mimami yɔse akɛ mitsiii mihe nɛkɛ po . <br>
(trg)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> Miye afii etɛ ni loloolo lɛ , minyɛɛɛ mawie . <br>
(trg)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Kɛkɛ ni miweku lɛ nu sane ko ni ha amɛnaa kpɛ amɛhe naakpa — datrɛfoi ma nɔ mi eha amɛ akɛ mimu toi kwraa ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> Mikã he miji gbekɛ beni mifɔlɔi tse gbãla , ni sɔ̃ bakã mimami kome too nɔ akɛ ekwɛ mi kɛ minyɛmimɛi krokomɛi — hii enyɔ kɛ yoo kome — lɛ atsiabo . <br>
(trg)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> No beaŋ yɛ France lɛ , atsɔɔɔ gbekɛbii ni ji mumui lɛ anii taakɛ bɔ ni atsɔɔ amɛ ŋmɛnɛ lɛ , ni bei komɛi lɛ , gbɛi ni atsɔɔ nɔ atsɔɔ amɛ nii lɛ haa amɛpiŋɔ waa . <br>
(trg)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Kɛlɛ , kɛjɛ migbekɛbiiashi tɔ̃ɔ lɛ , mishihilɛ lɛ hi kwraa fe mumui krokomɛi anɔ̃ . <br>
(trg)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Ha magbala mli matsɔɔ bo . <br>
(trg)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Akɛ enɛ tsu nii afii komɛi . <br>

<hr>
(src)="14"> Anɔkwa , agu mumuii awiemɔ kɛ nitsumɔ kwraa yɛ skul srɔtoi ni yɔɔ France , he ni mida yɛ lɛ amli . <br>
(trg)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Afimɔɔ mumui lɛ ekomɛi po aniji awoɔ amɛsɛɛ beni nikasemɔ yaa nɔ lɛ . <br>
(trg)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>

(trg)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Emɔɔ mikadaa loo miyitso ni enyɛɔ minɔ koni makɛɛ nibii komɛi ni mi diɛŋtsɛ lɛ minuuu amɛgbɛɛmɔ lɛ shii abɔ . <br>
(trg)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> No beaŋ lɛ , minyɛɛɛ mikɛ gbekɛbii krokomɛi agba sane . <br>
(trg)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Nakai afii lɛ bafee piŋmɔ bei kɛha mi . <br>
(trg)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Beni miye afii ekpaa lɛ , akɛ mi tee mumui askul ko ni awɔɔ jɛmɛ . <br>
(trg)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> No bafee klɛŋklɛŋ be kwraa ni mikɛ gbekɛbii krokomɛi ni ji mumui bɔi sharamɔ . <br>
(trg)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Biɛ hu agu mumui awiemɔ kɛ nitsumɔ . <br>
(trg)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Kɛ́ ana akɛ okɛ oniji miifee okadii kɛmiiwie nɔŋŋ lɛ , abaaha okɛ owaobii lɛ ahɔlɔ owaobii amli loo abaagbala oyitsɔi . <br>

(src)="24"> Fɛɛ sɛɛ lɛ , wɔtsɔɔ okadii komɛi ni wɔ diɛŋtsɛ wɔfee lɛ anɔ wɔkɛ wɔniji wieɔ yɛ teemɔŋ . <br>
(trg)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> Enɛ ha minyɛ mikɛ gbekɛbii krokomɛi lɛ bɔi wiemɔ agbɛnɛ . <br>
(trg)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> Miná miishɛɛ waa , ni etee nɔ afii ejwɛ sɔŋŋ . <br>
(trg)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Shi beni miye afii nyɔŋma lɛ , ajie mi kɛtee praimeri skul ko ni jeee mumuii askul . <br>
(trg)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> Enɛ gba minaa waa ! <br>
(trg)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> Miyasusu akɛ gbekɛbii ni ji mumuii lɛ fɛɛ egboi ni mikome too pɛ ni ji mumui ni eshwɛ yɛ je lɛŋ . <br>
(trg)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Miweku lɛ ekaseee mumui awiemɔ ejaakɛ datrɛfoi kɛɛ kɛ́ amɛkɛ mi wie mumuii awiemɔ lɛ , no haŋ manyɛ mawie , no hewɔ lɛ amɛŋmɛɛɛ mi gbɛ ni mikɛ gbekɛbii ni ji mumuii lɛ abɔ . <br>
(trg)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> Mikã he mikaiɔ be ko ni mitee datrɛfonyo ko ni tsuɔ toi he nii ŋɔɔ lɛ . <br>
(trg)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Mina mumuii awiemɔ wolo ko kã ekplɔ lɛ nɔ . <br>
(trg)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Beni mina esɛɛ mfonirii lɛ , mikɛ minine tsɔɔ wolo lɛ mikɛɛ , “ Miisumɔ nakai wolo lɛ ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> Oya nɔŋŋ kɛkɛ ni datrɛfonyo lɛ kɔ wolo lɛ kɛto . <br>
(trg)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>

<hr>
(src)="36"> Mimami bɔ mɔdɛŋ akɛ ekɛ Biblia mli shishitoo mlai atsɔse wɔ . <br>
(trg)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> Ekɛ wɔ yaa Kristofoi Yehowa Odasefoi akpee yɛ Mérignac Asafo ni bɛŋkɛ Bordeaux lɛ . <br>
(trg)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> Akɛni midako hewɔ lɛ , minuuu nibii ni yaa nɔ yɛ kpeei nɛɛ ashishi lɛ shishi tsɔ . <br>
(trg)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>

(trg)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> Mihiɛ sɔ suɔmɔ kɛ mɔhesusumɔ kpo ni amɛjie amɛtsɔɔ mi lɛ waa diɛŋtsɛ . <br>
(trg)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> Mimami kɛ mi kase Biblia lɛ yɛ shĩa , shi minuuu nibii ni etsɔɔ mi lɛ ashishi jogbaŋŋ . <br>
(trg)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> Minu he tamɔ gbalɔ Daniel nu he lɛ , beni enine shɛ gbalɛ ko nɔ kɛjɛ ŋwɛi bɔfo ko dɛŋ lɛ sɛɛ lɛ , ewie akɛ : “ Minu , shi minaaa shishi . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Shi migbɛfaŋ lɛ , “ Mina , shi minuuu shishi . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Kɛlɛ , fioo fioo lɛ mibale Biblia mli anɔkwalei komɛi . <br>
(trg)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Mikɛ nibii ni minu shishi jogbaŋŋ lɛ to , ni mibɔ mɔdɛŋ mikɛtsu nii yɛ mishihilɛ mli . <br>
(trg)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Mikase nii hu kɛtsɔ mɛi krokomɛi anifeemɔi ni mikwɛɔ lɛ anɔ . <br>
(trg)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> Akɛ nɔkwɛmɔnɔ lɛ , Biblia lɛ kɛɔ wɔ akɛ wɔto wɔtsui shi . <br>
(trg)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> No mli lɛ , minuuu nɔ ni tsuishitoo tsɔɔ lɛ shishi . <br>
(trg)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> Shi mikwɛ nyɛmimɛi Kristofoi ni jieɔ su nɛɛ kpo lɛ , ni kɛtsɔ no nɔ lɛ minyɛ minu nɔ ni tsuishitoo tsɔɔ lɛ shishi . <br>
(trg)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Eji anɔkwale akɛ Kristofoi asafo lɛ eye ebua mi waa diɛŋtsɛ . <br>
(trg)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Beni miji oblanyo fioo lɛ , gbi ko lɛ mina gbekɛbii komɛi ni amɛkɛ amɛhe miigba sane yɛ mumuii awiemɔ mli yɛ gbɛjegbɛ lɛ nɔ . <br>
(trg)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> Mikɛ amɛ bɔi bɔɔ yɛ teemɔŋ , ni mibɔi French Mumuii Awiemɔ lɛ kasemɔ . <br>
(trg)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Mikã he mitee Kristofoi akpeei ni mikɛ Odasefonyo oblanyo ni atsɛɔ lɛ Stéphane lɛ kpe , ni eŋɔ mi ewo efiji ashishi . <br>
(trg)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> Ebɔɔ mɔdɛŋ waa akɛ ekɛ mi baagba sane , ni no ha mibasumɔ esane ni mikɛ lɛ bɔ gbagbalii . <br>
(trg)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Kɛlɛ , asomoaŋ dɔlɛ sane ko miimɛ mi . <br>
(trg)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> Awo Stéphane tsuŋ akɛni ekpoo akɛ ekɛ ehe baawo asraafoi anitsumɔ mli lɛ hewɔ . <br>
(trg)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Sane lɛ gba minaa waa diɛŋtsɛ ! <br>
(trg)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Akɛni awo Stéphane tsuŋ hewɔ lɛ , minijiaŋ baje wui , ni fioo fioo lɛ mibakpa Kristofoi akpee yaa . <br>
(trg)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> Nyɔji nyɔŋma kɛ ekome sɛɛ lɛ , aŋmɛɛ Stéphane he , ni eba shĩa . <br>
(trg)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Baakwɛ bɔ ni minaa kpɛ mihe eha beni mina akɛ Stéphane kɛ mi miigba sane yɛ mumuii awiemɔ mli lɛ . <br>
(trg)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Mihiɛ fee mi yaa ! <br>
(trg)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Mɛni eba ? <br>
(trg)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Stéphane eyakase French Mumuii Awiemɔ yɛ tsuŋwoohe lɛ . <br>
(trg)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> Mikwɛ bɔ ni Stéphane fɔ̃ɔ eniji kɛ bɔ ni efeɔ ehiɛ ehaa lɛ , ni no ha mimiishɛɛ lɛ daa waa diɛŋtsɛ ejaakɛ misusuɔ bɔ ni maná he sɛɛ maha lɛ he . <br>
(trg)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> Stéphane kɛ mi bɔi Biblia lɛ kasemɔ . <br>
(trg)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Kɛjɛ nakai be lɛ nɔ kɛyaa ni mibabɔi Biblia mli anɔkwalei ni mikase kɛho lɛ ashishi numɔ jogbaŋŋ . <br>
(trg)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> Beni miji gbekɛ lɛ , minya asafo lɛ woji lɛ amli mfonirii fɛfɛji lɛ ahe waa . <br>

(trg)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> No mli lɛ , mile Abraham , ‘ eseshi lɛ , ’ kɛ “ asafo babaoo lɛ ” ahe nii , shi beni agbala saji nɛɛ amli aha mi yɛ mumuii awiemɔ mli dani mibanu shishi jogbaŋŋ diɛŋtsɛ . <br>
(trg)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> Ebafee faŋŋ akɛ miná mi diɛŋtsɛ miwiemɔ , wiemɔ ni kã mitsui nɔ . <br>
(trg)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Mibanu nibii ni atsɔɔ yɛ kpeei ashishi lɛ shishi jogbaŋŋ ni eta mitsuiŋ waa , ni no ha mishwe akɛ makase babaoo . <br>
(trg)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> Kɛtsɔ Stéphane yelikɛbuamɔ nɔ lɛ , mibanu Biblia mli anɔkwalei lɛ ashishi jogbaŋŋ , ni yɛ afi 1992 mli lɛ , mijɔɔ miwala nɔ miha Yehowa Nyɔŋmɔ , ni abaptisi mi . <br>
(trg)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Eyɛ mli akɛ mitee mihiɛ moŋ , shi loloolo lɛ no mli lɛ mihiɛ gboɔ , ni ewa kɛha mi akɛ mafutu mɛi ejaakɛ beni miji gbekɛ lɛ minyɛɛɛ mikɛ mɛi agba sane . <br>
(trg)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Sɛɛ mli lɛ , akɛ asafo lɛ mumuii akuu fioo ni mikɛbɔɔ lɛ yafata mumuii asafo ko ni yɔɔ Pessac yɛ Bordeaux lɛ he . <br>
(trg)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> No ye ebua mi waa ni mitee nɔ mitee hiɛ yɛ anɔkwale lɛ mli . <br>
(trg)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
<hr>

(trg)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> Gbalashihilɛ mli hefatalɔ komɛi , Gilles kɛ Elodie , bɔ mɔdɛŋ waa koni amɛkɛ mi agba sane . <br>
(trg)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>

(trg)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>

(trg)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Asafo nɛɛ mli mikɛ Vanessa ni he yɔɔ fɛo waa lɛ kpe yɛ . <br>

(trg)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
