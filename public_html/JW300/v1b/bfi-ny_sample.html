(trg)="35"> Anthu a Mulungu atachoka ku ukapolo wa ku Babulo , ena ankalankhula Chiaramu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Perhaps to indicate what was to come , Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic . ​ — See the footnotes to Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>

(trg)="39"> Alekizanda Wamkulu atayamba kulamulira m’madera ambiri , anthu a m’maderawo anayamba kulankhula Chigiriki . <br>

<hr>
(src)="37"> This translation , thought to have been done by 72 translators , became known as the Septuagint . <br>
(src)="38"> It was the first translation of the Bible and one of the most important . <br>
(src)="39"> Septuagint means “ Seventy . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> Baibulo limene linamasuliridwa m’Chigirikili ( Septuagint ) linali loyamba kumasuliridwa kuchokera m’Malemba oyambirira . <br>

(trg)="42"> * Pomasulira Baibuloli , ena ankamasulira liwu ndi liwu pomwe ena ankangomasulira mfundo za m’malembawo . <br>

(src)="41"> This translation is still important , as it gives scholars insight into the meaning of certain obscure Hebrew words and passages . <br>
(trg)="43"> Ayuda komanso Akhristu amene ankalankhula Chigiriki ankalemekeza Baibuloli ndipo ankaliona kuti ndi Mawu a Mulungu . <br>

(src)="42"> The work of so many translators resulted in varied translation styles , from literal to rather free . <br>
(trg)="44"> Kodi Yesu ayenera kuti ankaphunzitsa m’chilankhulo chiti ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Nevertheless , the Septuagint was viewed as God’s Word by Greek - speaking Jews and later by Christians . <br>
(trg)="45"> Yesu atabwera padziko lapansi , ayenera kuti ankalankhula komanso kuphunzitsa anthu m’Chiheberi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> What language did Jesus likely use to teach his disciples ? <br>
(src)="45"> When God’s firstborn came to earth , he likely spoke and taught in what the Bible calls Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="46"> Popeza Chiheberi cha m’nthawi ya atumwi chinalinso ndi mawu ena achiaramu , n’kutheka kuti Yesu ankagwiritsanso ntchito mawu achiaramu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(trg)="47"> Komabe ankadziwanso Chiheberi choyambirira chomwe Mose ndi aneneri ena anagwiritsa ntchito polemba mabuku awo , omwe ankawerengedwa m’masunagoge mlungu uliwonse . <br>

(src)="47"> However , he also knew the ancient Hebrew of Moses and the prophets , which was read each week in the synagogues . <br>
(trg)="48"> Anthu ena a ku Isiraeli ankalankhulanso Chigiriki ndi Chilatini . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> In addition , Greek and Latin were spoken in Israel . <br>
(trg)="49"> Komabe Malemba sanena ngati Yesu ankalankhulanso zilankhulo zimenezi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages . <br>
(trg)="50"> 8 , 9 . a ) Chikhristu chitafalikira , kodi anthu a Mulungu ambiri ankalankhula chilankhulo chiti ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>
(trg)="51"> ( b ) Kodi zimenezi zikusonyeza kuti Mulungu ndi wotani ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Jesus ’ early followers knew Hebrew , but after his death , his disciples spoke other languages . <br>
(trg)="52"> Otsatira a Yesu oyambirira ankalankhula Chiheberi , koma Yesu atamwalira Akhristu anayamba kugwiritsa ntchito zilankhulo zina . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>
(trg)="53"> ( Werengani Machitidwe 6 : 1 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="54"> Chikhristu chitafalikira , anthu a Mulungu ambiri ankalankhula Chigiriki osati Chiheberi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(src)="55"> Thus , the language of many disciples was Greek rather than Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="55"> Tikutero chifukwa chakuti mabuku a Maliko , Luka komanso Yohane , omwe amafotokoza zimene Yesu anaphunzitsa ndiponso kuchita , analembedwa ndiponso kufalitsidwa m’Chigiriki . <br>

(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="56"> * Makalata a mtumwi Paulo ndiponso mabuku ena analembedwanso m’Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(src)="58"> What does this indicate about Jehovah ? <br>
(trg)="57"> Anthu amene analemba Malemba Achigiriki akafuna kugwira mawu Malemba Achiheberi , nthawi zambiri ankatenga mawuwo m’Baibulo limene linamasuliridwa m’Chigiriki lija . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="58"> Mawu amenewa amapezekabe m’Baibulo ngakhale kuti amasiyana pang’ono ndi mawu a m’Malemba Achiheberi oyambirira . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> These quotations , which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording , are now part of the inspired Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="59"> Choncho Yehova analola kuti mawu ena a anthu amene anamasulira Baibulo lachigiriki lija apezeke m’Mawu ake . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="60"> Izi zikusonyeza kuti Mulungu sakondera chilankhulo kapena chikhalidwe chinachake . — Werengani Machitidwe 10 : 34 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="61"> Kodi taona kuti Yehova amalankhula bwanji ndi anthu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Our brief review of God’s communication with humans teaches us that Jehovah communicates according to need and circumstances . <br>
(trg)="62"> Pofika apa , taona kuti Yehova amalankhula ndi anthu mogwirizana ndi zimene zikufunika pa nthawiyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>
(trg)="63"> Iye satikakamiza kuphunzira chilankhulo chinachake kuti timudziwe ndiponso kumvetsa zimene amafuna . <br>

(trg)="64"> ( Werengani Zekariya 8 : 23 ; Chivumbulutso 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Jehovah directed the inspiration of the Bible , but he allowed it to be presented in different styles . <br>
(trg)="65"> N’zoona kuti Yehova anatsogolera kuti Baibulo lilembedwe . <br>
(trg)="66"> Komabe analola kuti anthu asankhe okha mawu amene angagwiritse ntchito polemba Baibulolo . <br>

(src)="69"> No . <br>

(src)="70"> For example , we may be aware of only a few of the original - language words that Jesus used . <br>
(trg)="70"> N’zoona kuti m’Baibulo muli mawu ochepa a chilankhulo chimene Yesu ankalankhula akamaphunzitsa anthu . <br>

(trg)="71"> Komabe Yehova anaonetsetsa kuti zimene Yesu anaphunzitsa zimasuliridwe m’Chigiriki ndiponso m’zilankhulo zina . <br>
