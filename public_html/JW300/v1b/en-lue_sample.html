<hr>
(src)="2"> HOW can we have a complete picture of how Jehovah God views women ? <br>
(trg)="2"> UNO natuhasa kutachikiza ngachilihi omu Yehova Kalunga amona mapwevo ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> One way is to examine the attitude and conduct of Jesus Christ , who is “ the image of the invisible God ” and who reflects perfectly God’s view of matters . <br>
(trg)="3"> Jila yimwe shina yakukekesa vilinga vyaYesu Kulishitu uze “ alifwana henyihenyi naKalunga ” uze eji kulinganga vyuma kweseka nomu Kalunga amwenamo vyuma . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> The dealings Jesus had with the women of his day show that Jehovah and Jesus respect women and that they certainly do not approve of the oppressive treatment that is so common in many lands today . <br>
(trg)="4"> Vyuma alingilenga Yesu kutalisa kumapwevo vamumakumbi enyi vyasolola nge Yehova naYesu vavumbika mapwevo kaha nawa veji kwivwanga kupihya hakumona mapwevo navavayanjisa nganomu chili makumbi ano . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Consider , for example , the occasion when Jesus spoke to a woman at a well . <br>
(trg)="5"> Achishinganyekenu lwola luze Yesu ahanjikile napwevo umwe halishima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> “ A woman of Samaria came to draw water , ” says John’s Gospel account , and “ Jesus said to her : ‘ Give me a drink . ’ ” <br>
(trg)="6"> Mukanda wamujimbu wamwaza waYowano watulweza ngwawo : “ Kwejile pwevo wakuSamaliya nakuswita meya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Jesus was willing to talk with a Samaritan woman in public , even though most Jews had no dealings with Samaritans . <br>
(trg)="7"> Yesu amwambile ngwenyi , Nguhaneko meya ngunwenga . ” <br>
(trg)="8"> Yesu alisuwile kushimutwila napwevo wakaSamaliya haze halishima numba tuhu vaYuleya vavavulu kavalivwasanyine navaSamaliyako . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> According to The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia , for Jews “ conversation with a woman in a public place was particularly scandalous . ” <br>
(trg)="9"> Mukanda waThe International Standard Bible Encyclopedia wamba ngwawo , vaYuleya vamwene nge “ chapwilenga hichuma chasonyi kaha nawa chaunyengwe lunga kushimutwila napwevo kuchihela chasanga . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Jesus , however , treated women with respect and consideration and was neither racially prejudiced nor gender prejudiced . <br>
(trg)="10"> Oloze Yesu avumbikilenga mapwevo nakuvevwila keke kaha nawa kavamwenenga ulumbi mwomwo yamiyachi yavoko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> On the contrary , it was to the Samaritan woman that Jesus for the first time plainly identified himself as the Messiah . ​ — John 4 : 7 - 9 , 25 , 26 . <br>
(trg)="11"> Pwevo wakaSamaliya ikiye apwile mutu watete kwivwa Yesu mwalijimbula ngwenyi ikiye Meshiya . — Yowano 4 : 7 - 9 , 25 , 26 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> On another occasion Jesus was approached by a woman who for 12 years had been suffering from an embarrassing and debilitating flow of blood . <br>
(trg)="12"> Halwola lweka nawa , kuli Yesu kwejile pwevo uze avijilenga musongo wakuhichisa manyinga hamyaka 12 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When she touched him , she was instantly healed . <br>
(trg)="13"> Musongo kana wapwile waupi kaha nawa wakwivwisa sonyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> “ Jesus turned around and , noticing her , said : ‘ Take courage , daughter ; your faith has made you well . ’ ” <br>
(trg)="14"> Omu asalikile livoko lyenyi hali Yesu , musongo wenyi wakumine hahaze vene . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> According to the Mosaic Law , a woman in her condition was not supposed to be in a crowd of people , let alone touch others . <br>
(trg)="15"> “ Oloze Yesu hakwalumuka nakumumona amwambile ngwenyi , Ove mwanami , likolezeze ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Yet , Jesus did not berate her . <br>
(trg)="16"> Kufwelela chove chinakuhindula . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Rather , he compassionately comforted her and addressed her as “ daughter . ” <br>
(trg)="18"> Oloze Yesu kamutenukilileko , amwivwililile keke nakumuvendejeka hakumuvuluka ngwenyi “ ove mwanami . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> How that word must have put her heart at ease ! <br>
(trg)="19"> Chikupu vene awa mazu evwishile ou pwevo kuwaha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> And how happy Jesus must have been to cure her ! <br>
(trg)="20"> NaYesu nawa evwile kuwaha hakuka ou pwevo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> After Jesus was resurrected , his first appearance was to Mary Magdalene and another of his disciples , whom the Bible refers to as “ the other Mary . ” <br>
(trg)="21"> Omu Yesu vamusangwile , asolokele chakavanga kuli Maliya wakuMangatala nakuli kambaji kenyi weka uze Mbimbiliya yavuluka ngwayo “ Maliya mukwavo . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Jesus could have appeared first to Peter , John , or one of the other male disciples . <br>
(trg)="22"> Yesu kachi alivangile kusoloka kuli Petulu naYowano chipwe kuli tumbaji twenyi veka vamalunga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Instead , he dignified women by allowing them to be the first eyewitnesses of his resurrection . <br>
(trg)="23"> Oloze avumbikile mapwevo hakuvetavisa vapwenga vatete kumumona hanyima yakusanguka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> An angel instructed them to inform Jesus ’ male disciples about this astonishing event . <br>
(trg)="24"> Kangelo uze vakawanyine kuchimbumbe avalwezele vayenga nakulweza tumbaji twaYesu vamalunga ngwavo Yesu nasanguka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Jesus said to the women : “ Go , report to my brothers . ” <br>
(trg)="25"> Omu vapwile nakukinduluka valiwanyine naYesu , kaha avalwezele ngwenyi : “ Yenu mukavalweze vandumbwami . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> Jesus was certainly not affected by the prejudices common to Jews of his day , according to which women could not serve as legal witnesses . <br>
(trg)="26"> Yesu kapwile nge vaYuleya vamumakumbi enyi vaze vamwenenga mapwevo ulumbi vaze kavetavililenga unjiho wakufuma kumapwevoko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> So , far from being biased against women or condoning chauvinistic attitudes toward them in any way , Jesus showed that he respected and appreciated women . <br>
(trg)="27"> Vyuma tunashimutwila vinasolola nge Yesu kamwenenga mapwevo ulumbi chipwe kuvapopololako , oloze avavumbikile nakuvamona kupwa vavalemu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> Violence against them was completely contrary to what Jesus taught , and his attitude , we can be sure , was a perfect reflection of the way his Father , Jehovah , sees things . <br>
(trg)="28"> Kuyanjisa mapwevo chalimbalaka navyuma anangwile Yesu nomu avamwenenga , ngocho tunahase kufwelela ngwetu omu mukiko naIse Yehova amona mapwevo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Women Under Divine Care <br>

<hr>
(src)="29"> The general pattern was one of subordination of women to men , just as slaves were subordinate to the free , and young to old . . . . <br>
(trg)="31"> Vatu vavavulu vamwenenga mapwevo kupwa mwishi yamalunga , nganomu vandungo vapwile mwishi yamwanakachisemi , nomu nawa vanyike apwile mwishi yamukulwane . . . . <br>

(trg)="32"> Vanyike vamalunga vavamwene kupwa vavalemu kuhambakana vamapwevo , kaha vakemba vamapwevo lwola lumwe vavasezelenga valifwile . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> That is how one Bible dictionary describes the prevailing attitude toward females in ancient times . <br>
(trg)="33"> Kakavulu mapwevo vavamwenenga nge vandungo . <br>

(trg)="34"> Mbimbiliya vayisonekele halwola kanelu kwapwilenga visemwa kanevi tunavuluka . <br>

(src)="33"> The Bible was written at a time when customs reflected this attitude . <br>
(trg)="35"> Chipwe ngocho , jishimbi jaKalunga jasolwele nge mapwevo vapwa vavalemu . <br>

(src)="34"> Even so , divine law as expressed in the Bible showed a high regard for women , which was in marked contrast with the attitudes of many ancient cultures . <br>
(trg)="36"> Chuma kana chalihandunwine nomu vatu vakushikulu vamwenenga mapwevo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Jehovah’s concern for the welfare of women is evident from the several instances in which he acted in behalf of his female worshippers . <br>
(trg)="37"> Unjiho wakusolola nge Yehova azakama mapwevo tunahase kuuwana hakukekesa mijimbu yize yavuluka omu akafwile vangamba jenyi vamapwevo . <br>

<hr>
(src)="38"> When two God - fearing Israelite midwives risked their lives to preserve Hebrew male children from infanticide in Egypt , Jehovah appreciatively “ presented them with families . ” <br>

<hr>
(src)="39"> He also answered Hannah’s fervent prayer . <br>
(trg)="41"> Yehova akumbulwile nawa kulomba chaHana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> And when the widow of a prophet faced a creditor who was about to take her children as slaves to pay off her debt , Jehovah did not leave her in the lurch . <br>
(trg)="42"> Kaha nawa Yehova akafwile tuliwe umwe wapwevo uze asombokele kuli kapolofweto omu mutu umwe asakile kumutambula vana venyi mwomwo yamukuli amukongwele . <br>

(src)="41"> Lovingly , God enabled the prophet Elisha to multiply her supply of oil so that she could pay the debt and still have sufficient oil for her family . <br>

(trg)="45"> Kakavulu vapolofweto vahuhumwinenga vatu vaze vayanjishilenga mapwevo . <br>

(src)="44"> The prophet Jeremiah told the Israelites in Jehovah’s name : “ Render justice and righteousness , and deliver the one that is being robbed out of the hand of the defrauder ; and do not maltreat any alien resident , fatherless boy or widow . <br>
(trg)="46"> Yehova atumine kapolofweto Yelemiya alwezele vaIsalele ngwenyi : “ Lingenunga mwachiyulo mwakwoloka , muvapulululengava vanapupu mumavoko avaka - kuvalyapula . <br>
