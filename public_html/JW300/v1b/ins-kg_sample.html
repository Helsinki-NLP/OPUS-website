(trg)="1"> DISOLO YA LUZINGU <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> Disolo ya Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="3"> Ntangu mono vandaka ti bamvula zole na 1975 , mama na mono monaka nde diambu mosi vandaka kukwendila ve na nitu na mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="4"> Ntangu yandi nataka mono na maboko , nduku mosi bwisaka kima ya kilo na pavema mpi yo salaka makelele ya ngolo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="5"> Mama monaka nde , mono nikanaka ve ata fioti . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="6"> Tii ntangu mono kumaka ti bamvula tatu , mono vandaka kutuba ve . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Na nima , dibuta na mono zwaka nsangu mosi ya mpasi ; doktere mosi zabisaka bo nde mono kele mpenza baba ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="8"> Ntangu mono vandaka mwana - fioti , bibuti na mono fwaka makwela , mpi mama yandi mosi vandaka kusansa mono ti bambuta na mono zole ya babakala mpi mosi ya nkento . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="9"> Na ntangu yina na France , bo vandaka ve kulonga bababa mutindu bo ke salaka yo bubu yai , mpi mbala mingi ba metode yina bo vandaka kusadila vandaka mpasi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="10"> Ata mpidina , banda bumwana na mono , mono zwaka dibaku yina bababa mingi vandaka ve ti yo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="11"> Bika mono tela beno . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="12"> Mwa bamvula na ntwala , balongi mingi vandaka kuyindula nde sambu na kulonga bana yina vandaka bababa , bo fwete lomba bo na ngolo na kutala mutindu bikobo ya longi ke nikana ntangu yandi ke tuba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="13"> Nkutu , na France , kisika ya mono yelaka , ba ekole vandaka kubuyisa kusadila ndinga ya bidimbu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="14"> Ntangu longi ke longa , bo vandaka nkutu kukanga maboko ya bana ya nkaka yina vandaka bababa bansinga na mukongo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="15"> Ntangu mono vandaka ntete mwana - fioti , mono vandaka kulutisa bangunga mingi konso mposo ti munganga yina vandaka kulonga bababa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="16"> Bo vandaka kusimba mono na matama to na ntu mpi kupusa mono na ngolo na kutuba mbala na mbala bangogo yina mono vandaka kuwa ve . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="17"> Mono vandaka kukuka ve kusolula ti bana ya nkaka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="18"> Yo vandaka bamvula ya mpasi mpenza sambu na mono ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="19"> Na nima , ntangu mono kumaka ti bamvula sambanu , bo tindaka mono na interna na nzo - nkanda ya bababa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="20"> Sambu na mbala ya ntete , mono kutanaka ti bana ya nkaka yina vandaka bababa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="21"> Kuna mpi , bo buyisaka kusadila ndinga ya bidimbu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="22"> Kana beto sala bidimbu na nzo - nkanda , bo vandaka kubula beto na misapi ya maboko to kubenda ngolo nsuki na beto . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="23"> Kansi , beto basisaka beto mosi bidimbu yina beto vandaka kusadila na kinsweki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="24"> Nsuka - nsuka , mono kumaka kusolula ti bana ya nkaka kukonda mpasi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="25"> Yo vandaka bamvula iya ya kiese . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="26"> Kansi , ntangu mono kumaka ti bamvula 10 , mono kotaka na nzo - nkanda ya ntete kumosi ti bana yina kele ve bababa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="27"> Mono lembaka nitu mpenza ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="28"> Mono yindulaka nde , bababa yonso fwaka mpi mono bikalaka kaka mono mosi na ntoto ya mvimba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="29"> Sambu dibuta na mono vandaka kulanda bandongisila ya minganga , yina vandaka kuwa boma nde mono lendaka kuvidisa makuki na mono ya kutuba , bo longukaka ve ndinga ya bidimbu mpi bo vandaka kupesa mono ve nswa ya kuvukana ti bana yina vandaka bababa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="30"> Mono ke vilaka ve kilumbu yina beto kwendaka na munganga mosi yina ke sadisaka bababa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="31"> Yandi vandaka ti mukanda ya ndinga ya bidimbu na zulu ya mesa na yandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="32"> Ntangu mono monaka bifwanisu yina vandaka na lutiti ya zulu , mono songisaka yo musapi mpi tubaka nde : “ Mono ke zola yai ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="33"> Mpi munganga bumbaka yo nswalu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="34"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="35"> Mama salaka bikesa sambu na kusansa beto na minsiku ya Biblia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="36"> Yandi vandaka kunata beto na balukutakanu ya Bambangi ya Yehowa na dibundu ya Mérignac , penepene ya mbanza Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="37"> Sambu mono vandaka mwana - fioti mono vandaka kubakisa mambu fioti kaka na balukutakanu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="38"> Kansi , bampangi ya dibundu vandaka kufonga pene - pene na mono , mpi kana mosi me telama ya nkaka vandaka kuyinga sambu na kusonikila mono banoti ya mambu yina bo vandaka kulonga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="39"> Zola mpi dikebi na bo simbaka ntima na mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="40"> Na nzo , mama vandaka kulonguka Biblia ti mono , kansi mono vandaka kubakisa mbote - mbote ve mambu yango . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> Mono kudimonaka bonso profete Daniele yina , na nima ya kubaka mbikudulu na wanzio , tubaka nde : ‘ Mono waka mambu ya yandi vandaka kutuba kansi mono lendaka kubakisa ve . ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> Sambu na mono , “ Mono monaka kansi mono lendaka kubakisa ve . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="43"> Ata mpidina , malembe - malembe mono yantikaka kubakisa bakieleka ya nkaka ya mfunu ya Biblia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="44"> Mono vandaka kusepela na malongi yina mono vandaka kubakisa mpi kusala bikesa sambu na kusadila yo na luzingu na mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="45"> Mono longukaka mpi na kutala bikalulu ya bampangi ya nkaka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="46"> Mu mbandu , Biblia ke zabisaka beto na kuvanda ntima nda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="47"> Ata mpidina , mono vandaka kubakisa mpenza ve ntendula na yo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="48"> Kansi , ntangu mono vandaka kumona mutindu bampangi ya dibundu vandaka kumonisa kikalulu yina , mono bakisaka mbote - mbote ntendula na yo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="49"> Ya kieleka , dibundu ya Bukristu sadisaka mono mingi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="50"> Kilumbu mosi , ntangu mono vandaka toko , mono monaka batoko ya bababa na nzila mpi bo vandaka kusolula na bidimbu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="51"> Mono yantikaka kuvukana ti bo na kinsweki mpi kulonguka ndinga ya bidimbu ya insi France ( LSF ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="52"> Mono landaka kukwenda na balukutakanu ya dibundu , kisika mono kutanaka ti toko mosi na zina ya Stéphane , yina tudilaka mono dikebi ya mingi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="53"> Yandi salaka bikesa mingi sambu na kusolula ti mono , mpi beto kumaka banduku ya ngolo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="54"> Kansi , diambu mosi ya mawa vandaka kuvingila mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="55"> Bo kotisaka Stéphane na boloko sambu yandi buyaka kukuma soda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="56"> Mono lembaka nitu mpenza ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="57"> Na nsungi yonso yina Stéphane vandaka na boloko , mono lembaka nitu mpi yambulaka kukwenda na balukutakanu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="58"> Bangonda 11 na nima , bo basisaka Stéphane na boloko mpi yandi vutukaka na nzo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="59"> Yindula kiese ya mingi yina mono waka ntangu Stéphane yantikaka diaka kusolula ti mono na ndinga ya bidimbu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="60"> Mono yitukaka ngolo mpenza ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="61"> Inki salamaka ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="62"> Ntangu Stéphane vandaka na boloko , yandi longukaka ndinga ya bidimbu ya France . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="63"> Mono vandaka kutala bidimbu yina Stéphane vandaka kusala na maboko mpi na luse na yandi , mpidina mono vandaka kuwa kiese mingi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="64"> Stéphane yantikaka kulonguka Biblia ti mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="65"> Yo vandaka na ntangu yina mono kumaka ti makuki ya kubakisa bakieleka yonso ya Biblia yina mono longukaka na ntwala . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="66"> Ntangu mono vandaka mwana - fioti , mono vandaka kuzola kutala bifwanisu ya kitoko ya mikanda na beto yina ke tendulaka Biblia mpi kufwanisa bifwanisu ya bantu yina kele na mikanda yango ti diambu mosi mosi sambu nde disolo yango kubikala na mabanza na mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="67"> Mono zabaka mambu mingi na yina me tala Abrahami “ nkuna ” na yandi mpi ‘ kibuka ya nene , ’ kansi mono bakisaka mbote - mbote ntendula ya malongi yina kaka ntangu bo tendudilaka mono mambu yai na ndinga ya bidimbu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="68"> Yo vandaka pwelele nde , mono monaka nde ndinga ya bidimbu vandaka ndinga na mono mpenza , ndinga ya ntima na mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="69"> Sambu ntangu yai mono kumaka kubakisa mambu yina bo vandaka kulonga na balukutakanu mpi yo vandaka kusimba ntima na mono , mono kumaka na mpusa ya kulonguka mambu mingi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="70"> Ti lusadisu ya Stéphane , nzayilu na mono ya Biblia landaka kuyela , mpi na 1992 , mono kudipesaka na Yehowa Nzambi mpi bakaka mbotika . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="71"> Kansi , ata mono yelaka mpenza , mono vandaka kaka nsoni - nsoni mpi kukuka ve kusolula ti bantu ya nkaka sambu ntangu mono vandaka mwana - fioti , mono vandaka ve kusolula ti bantu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="72"> Nsuka - nsuka , kimvuka mosi ya bababa yina mono vandaka kuvukana ti bo vukanaka na dibundu mosi na Pessac , na Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="73"> Yo sadisaka mono mingi na kuyela na kimpeve . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="74"> Ata mono vandaka kaka kunwana ti kikalulu na mono ya nsoni - nsoni , banduku na mono yina vandaka ve bababa vandaka kutudila mono dikebi sambu na kuzikisa nde mono vandaka kubakisa mambu yonso . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="75"> Gilles ti nkento na yandi Elodie , salaka bikesa ya ngolo sambu na kusolula ti mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="76"> Mbala mingi bo vandaka kubinga mono sambu na kudia to kunwa kafe ti bo na nima ya balukutakanu , mpidina beto yedisaka kinduku ya ngolo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="77"> Yo vandaka kiese mpenza na kuvanda na kati ya bantu yina ke fululaka zola ya Nzambi ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="78"> Yo kele na dibundu yina mono kutanaka ti Vanessa , mpangi nkento mosi ya kitoko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="79"> Mono sepelaka na dikebi na yandi mpi bikalulu na yandi ya lunungu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="80"> Yandi vandaka kumona ve nde kukonda kutuba na mono vandaka ndilu sambu na kusolula , kansi bonso dibaku ya kulonguka kusolula ti baba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
(trg)="81"> Beto zolanaka mpi beto kwelanaka na 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="82"> Ata mono vandaka ti bandilu sambu na kusolula mbote - mbote , Vanessa sadisaka mono na kunwana ti kikalulu na mono ya nsoni - nsoni mpi na kusolula kukonda mpasi ti bankaka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
(trg)="83"> Mono ke sepelaka mingi na lusadisu na yandi ntangu mono ke lungisaka mikumba na mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
(trg)="84"> Kaka na mvula yina beto kwelanaka , biro ya filiale ya Bambangi ya Yehowa ya France yina kele na Louviers , bingisaka mono na kukwenda kubaka formasio ya ngonda mosi sambu na kisalu ya kubalula mikanda . <br>

(trg)="85"> Na bamvula yina me luta , biro ya filiale salaka kisalu ya ngolo sambu na kubasisa mikanda mingi na ndinga ya bidimbu ya France na DVD . <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>

(trg)="86"> Kansi , sambu kisalu mingi vandaka kuvingila bo na makwisa , departema ya bambaludi vandaka na mfunu ya lusadisu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
(trg)="87"> Mono ti Vanessa monaka nde , kusala na Betele vandaka dibaku mosi ya nene mpi dikabu yina katukaka na Yehowa Nzambi , kansi ata mpidina beto vandaka kudiyangisa mwa fioti . <br>

<hr>
(src)="94"> Would Vanessa find work in the region ? <br>
(trg)="90"> Keti Vanessa ta zwa kisalu na mbanza yina ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
(trg)="91"> Na mutindu mosi ya kuyituka , Yehowa pesaka mvutu ya mbote na mambu yina yonso . <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>
(trg)="92"> Mono monaka mpenza nde Yehowa ke zolaka beto mpi bababa . <br>
