(src)="1"> “ I Set the Pattern for You ” <br>
(trg)="1"> “ Na Yi Muku Kwatanci ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> “ You ought to be teachers in view of the time . ” ​ — HEBREWS 5 : 12 . <br>
(trg)="2"> “ Domin daɗewarku , ku zama masu - koyarwa . ” — IBRANIYAWA 5 : 12 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Why might the words of Hebrews 5 : 12 naturally cause a Christian to feel some measure of concern ? <br>
(trg)="3"> Me ya sa kalmomi da suke Ibraniyawa 5 : 12 za su sa Kirista ya damu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> AS YOU read the inspired words of our theme text , do you feel a measure of concern about yourself ? <br>
(trg)="4"> SA’AD da kake karanta ayar jigonmu , kana tunani game da kanka ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> If so , you are not alone . <br>
(trg)="5"> Idan haka ne , to ba kai kaɗai ba ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> As followers of Christ , we know that we must be teachers . <br>
(trg)="6"> Da yake mu mabiyan Kristi ne , mun sani cewa dole ne mu zama masu koyarwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> We know that the times in which we live make it urgent that we teach as well as we can . <br>
(trg)="7"> ( Matta 28 : 19 , 20 ) Mun sani cewa lokaci da muke ciki ya bukaci mu ƙware wajen koyarwa da gaggawa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> And we know that our teaching can even make a life - or - death difference to those whom we teach ! <br>
(trg)="8"> Mun kuma sani cewa koyarwarmu za ta sa rai ko mutuwa a gaban waɗanda muke koyar da su ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Naturally , then , we may ask ourselves : ‘ Am I really the teacher I ought to be ? <br>
(trg)="9"> ( 1 Timothawus 4 : 16 ) Za mu iya tambayar kanmu : ‘ Ni mai koyarwa ne yadda ya kamata na zama kuwa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> How can I improve ? ’ <br>
(trg)="10"> Ta yaya zan yi gyara ? ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> 2 , 3 . ( a ) How did one teacher explain the foundation of good teaching ? <br>
(trg)="11"> 2 , 3 . ( a ) Yaya wani malami ya yi bayanin tushen koyarwa da kyau ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> ( b ) Jesus set what pattern for us as to teaching ? <br>
(trg)="12"> ( b ) Yesu ya bar mana wane kwatanci ne na koyarwa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Such concerns need not discourage us . <br>
(trg)="13"> Irin wannan damuwar bai kamata ta sa mu kasala ba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> If we think of teaching solely in terms of some studied techniques , we might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of making improvements . <br>
(trg)="14"> Idan muna ɗaukan koyarwa aba ce da ke bukatar wasu hanyoyin koyarwa na musamman , za mu ga cewa zai yi mana wuya ainu mu yi gyara . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> The foundation of good teaching , though , is not technique but something far more important . <br>
(trg)="15"> Amma , tushen koyarwa mai kyau , ba batun gwaninta ba ne amma abu ne mafi muhimmanci . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Note what one experienced teacher wrote in a book on the subject : “ Good teaching is not a matter of specific techniques or styles , plans or actions . . . . <br>
(trg)="16"> Ka lura da abin da wani masani wajen koyarwa ya rubuta a wani littafi : “ Koyarwa da kyau ba ta dangana a kan gwaninta na musamman ba ko wani salo , shiri , ko kuma ayyuka ba . . . . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Teaching is primarily a matter of love . ” <br>
(trg)="17"> Koyarwa ainihi batun ƙauna ce . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> Of course , his perspective was that of a secular teacher . <br>
(trg)="18"> Hakika , ra’ayinsa ba na addini ba ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Still , his point may be even more applicable to the teaching we do as Christians . <br>
(trg)="19"> Amma , ra’ayinsa zai yi amfani a koyarwa da muke yi mu Kiristoci . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> How so ? <br>
(trg)="20"> Ta yaya ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Our Exemplar of a teacher is none other than Jesus Christ , who told his followers : “ I set the pattern for you . ” <br>
(trg)="21"> Wanda muke bin misalinsa ba wani ba ne Yesu Kristi ne kansa , wanda ya gaya wa mabiyansa : “ Na yi muku kwatanci . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> He was referring to his example in showing humility , but the pattern Jesus set for us certainly includes his principal work as a man on earth ​ — that of teaching people the good news of God’s Kingdom . <br>
(trg)="22"> ( Yohanna 13 : 15 ) Yana nuni ne ga misalinsa a nuna tawali’u , amma kwatanci da Yesu ya yi mana ya ƙunshi aikinsa da ya fi muhimmanci sa’ad da yake duniya — na koyar da mutane bishara ta Mulkin Allah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Now , if you had to choose a single word to characterize Jesus ’ ministry , you would likely select the word “ love , ” would you not ? <br>
(trg)="23"> ( Luka 4 : 43 ) Idan za ka zaɓi kalma guda ka kwatanta hidimar Yesu , za ka zaɓi kalmar nan “ ƙauna , ” ko ba haka ba ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> Jesus ’ love for his heavenly Father , Jehovah , was paramount . <br>
(trg)="24"> ( Kolossiyawa 1 : 15 ; 1 Yohanna 4 : 8 ) Ƙaunar Yesu ga Ubansa na samaniya Jehovah ne , ya fi muhimmanci . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> As a teacher , though , Jesus manifested love in two additional ways . <br>
(trg)="25"> ( Yohanna 14 : 31 ) Da yake Yesu mai koyarwa ne , ya nuna ƙauna a ƙarin hanyoyi biyu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> He loved the truths he taught , and he loved the people he taught . <br>
(trg)="26"> Yana ƙaunar gaskiya da ya koyar , kuma ya yi ƙaunar mutane da ya koya musu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Let us focus more closely on these two aspects of the pattern he set for us . <br>
(trg)="27"> Bari mu mai da hankali sosai a kan waɗannan fannoni biyu na kwatanci da ya bar mana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> A Long - Standing Love of Divine Truths <br>
(trg)="28"> Ƙauna ta Allah Gaskiya Ce da ta Daɗe <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> How did Jesus form a love for Jehovah’s teachings ? <br>
(trg)="29"> Ta yaya Yesu ya gina ƙauna ga koyarwar Jehovah ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> A teacher’s attitude toward his subject has a considerable bearing on the quality of his teaching . <br>
(trg)="30"> Halin malami ga darasi da yake koyarwa na shafan kyan koyarwarsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> Any indifference will likely show and spread to his students . <br>
(trg)="31"> Za a ga cewa ba ya son darasi da yake koyarwa kuma haka ɗalibansa za su ji . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Jesus felt no apathy toward the precious truths he taught about Jehovah and His Kingdom . <br>
(trg)="32"> Yesu ya yi ƙaunar gaskiya mai tamani da ya koyar game da Jehovah da Mulkinsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Jesus ’ love for this subject was profound . <br>
(trg)="33"> Ƙaunar Yesu ga wannan darasi tana da zurfi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> He had formed that love as a student . <br>
(trg)="34"> Ya gina wannan ƙaunar lokacin da yake ɗalibi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Throughout the long ages of his prehuman existence , the only - begotten Son was an avid learner . <br>
(trg)="35"> Shekaru da yawa da ya yi kafin ya zama mutum , Ɗa makaɗaici , mai koyo ne ƙwarai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Isaiah 50 : 4 , 5 records these fitting words : “ The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has given me the tongue of the taught ones , that I may know how to answer the tired one with a word . <br>
(src)="37"> He awakens morning by morning ; he awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones . <br>
(trg)="36"> Ishaya 50 : 4 , 5 ta rubuta waɗannan kalmomi da suka dace : “ Ubangiji Yahweh ya ba ni harshe na koyayyun mutane , domin in san yadda zan tokare da magana wanda ya gaji : safiya kan safiya ya kan tashe ni , ya kan farkarda kunnena domin in ji kamar koyayyun mutane . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear , and I , for my part , was not rebellious . <br>
(src)="39"> I did not turn in the opposite direction . ” <br>
(trg)="37"> Ubangiji Yahweh ya buɗe kunnena , ban yi tayarwa ba , ban kuwa bada baya ba . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> 5 , 6 . ( a ) What experience did Jesus evidently have at his baptism , with what effect upon him ? <br>
(trg)="38"> 5 , 6 . ( a ) Menene Yesu ya gani sa’ad da ya yi baftisma , yaya wannan ya shafe shi ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> ( b ) What contrast do we find between Jesus and Satan as to using God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="39"> ( b ) Wane bambanci muka gani game da yadda Yesu da Shaiɗan suka yi amfani da Kalmar Allah ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> While growing up as a human on earth , Jesus continued to love divine wisdom . <br>
(trg)="40"> Da ya zama mutum yake girma a duniya , Yesu ya ci gaba da ƙaunar hikima ta Allah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Then , at the time of his baptism , he went through a unique experience . <br>
(trg)="41"> ( Luka 2 : 52 ) Sa’annan , a lokacin baftismarsa , ya ga wani abu na musamman . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> “ The heaven was opened up , ” says Luke 3 : 21 . <br>
(trg)="42"> “ Sama ta buɗe , ” in ji Luka 3 : 21 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Evidently , Jesus was then able to recall his prehuman existence . <br>
(trg)="43"> Yesu , babu shakka lokacin ya tuna da rayuwarsa kafin ya zama mutum . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Thereafter he spent 40 days fasting in the wilderness . <br>
(trg)="44"> Bayan haka ya yi kwanaki 40 yana azumi cikin daji . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> He must have found intense delight in meditating on the many heavenly sessions of instruction he had received from Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="45"> Ya yi farin ciki sosai na bimbini a kan koyarwa da Jehovah ya koyar da shi lokacin da yake sama . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Before long , though , his love of God’s truths was put to the test . <br>
(trg)="46"> Ba da daɗewa ba , aka gwada ƙaunarsa ga gaskiya ta Allah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> When Jesus was fatigued and hungry , Satan sought to tempt him . <br>
(trg)="47"> Sa’ad da Yesu ya gaji kuma yana jin yunwa , Shaiɗan ya jarabe shi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> What a contrast we find between these two sons of God ! <br>
(trg)="48"> Lallai da bambanci tsakanin waɗannan ’ ya’yan Allah biyu ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Both quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures ​ — but with a completely different spirit . <br>
(trg)="49"> Dukansu sun yi ƙaulin Nassosin Ibrananci — amma da nufi dabam dabam . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> Satan twisted God’s Word , disrespectfully using it to serve his own selfish ends . <br>
(trg)="50"> Shaiɗan ya canja ma’anar Kalmar Allah , cikin rashin biyayya ya yi amfani da ita ya biya bukatarsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Really , that rebel had nothing but contempt for divine truths . <br>
(trg)="51"> Hakika , wannan ɗan tawayen yana ƙyamar gaskiya ta Allah ne kawai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> On the other hand , Jesus quoted the Scriptures with obvious love , using God’s Word carefully in each reply . <br>
(trg)="52"> A wani ɓangare kuma , Yesu ya yi ƙaulin Nassosi da ƙauna , yana amfani da Kalmar Allah a kowacce amsa da ya bayar . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Jesus had been in existence long before those inspired words were first written down , yet he held them in reverence . <br>
(trg)="53"> Yesu ya wanzu da daɗewa kafin a rubuta waɗannan hurarrun kalmomi , duk da haka ya daraja su . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> They were precious truths from his heavenly Father ! <br>
(trg)="54"> Gaskiya ne masu tamani daga Ubansa na samaniya ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> He told Satan that such words from Jehovah were more vital than food . <br>
(trg)="55"> Ya gaya wa Shaiɗan cewa irin wannan kalmomi daga Jehovah sun fi abinci muhimmanci . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Yes , Jesus loved all the truths that Jehovah had taught him . <br>
(trg)="56"> ( Matta 4 : 1 - 11 ) Hakika , Yesu ya yi ƙaunar dukan gaskiya da Jehovah ya koya masa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> How , though , did he display that love as a teacher ? <br>
(trg)="57"> Amma ta yaya ya nuna wannan ƙauna da yake shi malami ne ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Love for the Truths He Taught <br>
(trg)="58"> Ƙaunar Gaskiya da Ya Koyar <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Why did Jesus refrain from inventing his own teachings ? <br>
(trg)="59"> Me ya sa Yesu bai ƙirƙiro nasa koyarwa ba ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Jesus ’ love for the truths he taught was always apparent . <br>
(trg)="60"> Ƙaunar Yesu ga gaskiya da ya koyar a bayyane take koyaushe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> After all , he might easily have developed his own ideas . <br>
(trg)="61"> Ballantana ma , yana da sauƙi ya iya gina nasa ra’ayoyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He possessed a vast repository of knowledge and wisdom . <br>
(trg)="62"> Yana da ilimi da hikima sosai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> Nevertheless , he reminded his listeners again and again that everything he taught originated , not with himself , but with his heavenly Father . <br>
(trg)="63"> ( Kolossiyawa 2 : 3 ) Duk da haka , ya tuna wa masu sauraronsa a kai a kai cewa kome da ya koyar ya zo daga Ubansa na samaniya ne ba daga wurinsa ba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> He loved divine truths far too much to replace them with his own thinking . <br>
(trg)="64"> ( Yohanna 7 : 16 ; 8 : 28 ; 12 : 49 ; 14 : 10 ) Ya yi ƙaunar gaskiya da ta zo daga wajen Allah sosai da ba zai sake ta da nasa ra’ayi ba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> At the start of his ministry , how did Jesus set a pattern of relying on God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="65"> A farkon hidimarsa , yaya Yesu ya kafa misali na dogara da Kalmar Allah ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> When Jesus began his public ministry , he quickly set a pattern . <br>
(trg)="66"> Sa’ad da Yesu ya soma hidimarsa ga jama’a , ya kafa kwatanci nan da nan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> Consider the way he first declared to God’s people that he was the promised Messiah . <br>
(trg)="67"> Yi la’akari da hanya da ya sanar wa mutanen Allah da farko cewa shi ne Almasihun da aka yi alkawarinsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> Did he simply appear before crowds , proclaim himself Christ , and then perform spectacular miracles to prove his point ? <br>
(trg)="68"> Kawai ya bayyana a gaban jama’a , ya ce shi Kristi ne , kuma ya yi mu’ujizoji na musamman don ya tabbatar da abin da ya ce ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> No . <br>
(trg)="69"> A’a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> He went to a synagogue , where God’s people habitually read from the Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="70"> Ya je majami’a inda mutanen Allah sun saba zuwa suna karanta Nassosi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> There he read aloud the prophecy of Isaiah 61 : 1 , 2 and explained that these prophetic truths applied to him . <br>
(trg)="71"> A wajen ya karanta annabcin Ishaya 61 : 1 , 2 da murya , kuma ya yi bayanin wannan gaskiya ta annabci cewa game da shi ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> His many miracles helped to establish that he had Jehovah’s backing . <br>
(trg)="72"> ( Luka 4 : 16 - 22 ) Mu’ujizoji da yawa da ya yi sun taimaka wajen nuna cewa yana da goyon bayan Jehovah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> Still , he always relied on God’s Word in his teaching . <br>
(trg)="73"> Duk da haka , koyaushe ya dogara da Kalmar Allah a koyarwarsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> In his dealings with the Pharisees , how did Jesus show his loyal love for God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="74"> A sha’aninsa da Farisawa , yaya Yesu ya nuna ƙauna ta gaske ga Kalmar Allah ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> When Jesus was challenged by religious opponents , he did not engage them in a duel of wits , although he could easily have outdone them in such a contest . <br>
(trg)="75"> Sa’ad da ’ yan adawa na addini suka zargi Yesu , bai yi ƙoƙari ya ci nasara bisa kansu ba , ko da zai iya cinsu a irin wannan batun . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> Rather , he let God’s Word refute them . <br>
(trg)="76"> Maimako , ya bar Kalmar Allah ta nuna musu cewa koyarwarsu ba daidai ba ce . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> Recall , for instance , when the Pharisees charged that Jesus ’ followers had violated the Sabbath law by plucking a few heads of grain in a field and eating them while passing through . <br>
(trg)="77"> Alal misali , ka tuna , sa’ad da Farisawa suka ce mabiyan Yesu sun taka dokar Asabarci ta tsinkar hatsi a gona kuma suna ci sa’ad da suke wucewa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Jesus replied : “ Have you not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry ? ” <br>
(trg)="78"> Yesu ya amsa : “ Ba ku karanta abin da Dauda ya yi ba , sa’anda ya ji yunwa , da waɗanda ke tare da shi . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> Of course , those self - righteous men may well have read that inspired account recorded at 1 Samuel 21 : 1 - 6 . <br>
(trg)="79"> ( Matta 12 : 1 - 5 ) Babu shakka , waɗannan mutane masu adalcin kai sun karanta wannan hurarren labari da ke 1 Samu’ila 21 : 1 - 6 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> If so , they had failed to discern an important lesson that it contained . <br>
(trg)="80"> Idan haka ne , sun kasa fahimtar muhimmin darasi da ke ƙunshe cikinsa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> Jesus , however , had done more than read the account . <br>
(trg)="81"> Amma Yesu ya yi fiye da karanta labarin . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> He had thought about it and taken its message to heart . <br>
(trg)="82"> Ya yi tunani a kan ma’anarsa kuma ya amince da darasi da za a koya daga ciki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> He loved the principles that Jehovah taught by means of that passage . <br>
(trg)="83"> Ya yi ƙaunar ƙa’idodi da Jehovah ya koyar ta wannan ayar . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> So he used that account , as well as an example from the Mosaic Law , to reveal the balanced spirit of the Law . <br>
(trg)="84"> Ya yi amfani da labarin , da kuma misali daga Dokar Musa , don ya bayyana amfanin Dokar . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> Similarly , Jesus ’ loyal love moved him to defend God’s Word against the efforts of religious leaders to twist it to their own ends or bury it under a morass of human traditions . <br>
(trg)="85"> Hakanan , ƙauna ta gaske ta Yesu ta motsa shi ya goyi bayan Kalmar Allah maimakon ƙoƙarin shugabanan addinai da suka rage ma’anarta don su amfani kansu ko kuma su ɓoye ta a ƙarƙashin al’adu na mutane da ke rikitarwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> How did Jesus fulfill prophecies regarding the quality of his teaching ? <br>
(trg)="86"> Ta yaya Yesu ya cika annabce - annabce game da ingancin koyarwarsa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> Jesus ’ love of his subject would never allow him to teach merely by rote , in a manner that was tired or mechanical . <br>
(trg)="87"> Ƙaunar Yesu ga gaskiyar da ya koyar ba za ta ƙyale shi ya koyar ta haddacewa , a hanyar da ke gajiyarwa ko kuma ta rashin tarbiyya ba . <br>
<hr>
(src)="90"> Inspired prophecies had suggested that the Messiah would speak with ‘ charm on his lips , ’ using “ words of elegance . ” <br>
(trg)="88"> Hurarrun annabce - annabce sun ce Almasihu zai yi magana da ‘ alheri a bisa leɓunansa , ’ ya yi amfani da “ nagargarun zantattuka . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Jesus fulfilled those prophecies by keeping his message fresh and alive , using “ winsome words ” as he taught the truths he so loved . <br>
(trg)="89"> ( Zabura 45 : 2 ; Farawa 49 : 21 ) Yesu ya cika waɗannan annabce - annabce ta sa saƙonsa ya kasance da marmari kuma a bayyane , ya yi amfani da “ zantattukan alheri ” sa’ad da yake koyar da gaskiya da yake so sosai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> No doubt his enthusiasm animated his features , and his eyes shone with a lively interest in his subject . <br>
(trg)="90"> ( Luka 4 : 22 ) Babu shakka ƙwazonsa ya sa ya yi murmushi , idanunsa kuma sun nuna yana son darasi da ya koyar . <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> What a pleasure it must have been to listen to him , and what a fine pattern for us to follow when we talk to others about what we have learned ! <br>
(trg)="91"> Abu ne mai kyautarwa mu saurare shi , misali ne mai kyau da za mu bi sa’ad da muke gaya wa wasu game da abin da muka koya ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> Why did Jesus ’ abilities as a teacher never cause him to become puffed up with pride ? <br>
(trg)="92"> Me ya sa iyawar Yesu na malanta bai sa ya zama mai fahariya ba ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> Did Jesus ’ immense grasp of divine truths and his winning way with words induce him to become puffed up with pride ? <br>
(trg)="93"> Yadda Yesu ya fahimci gaskiya ta Allah da yadda yake amfani da kalmomi da kyau ya sa shi ya zama mai fahariya ne ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> That often happens in the case of human teachers . <br>
(trg)="94"> Sau da yawa haka yake faruwa tsakanin malamai ’ yan Adam . <br>
<hr>
(src)="97"> Remember , though , that Jesus was wise in a godly way . <br>
(trg)="95"> Amma ka tuna cewa Yesu ya nuna hikima a hanyar da ta nuna yana tsoron Allah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="98"> Such wisdom does not allow for haughtiness , for “ wisdom is with the modest ones . ” <br>
(trg)="96"> Irin wannan hikima ba ta sa fahariya , domin “ wurin masu - tawali’u akwai hikima . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="99"> There was something else that kept Jesus from turning proud or haughty . <br>
(trg)="97"> ( Misalai 11 : 2 ) Har yanzu da wani abin da ya sa Yesu bai zama mai fahariya ba ko kuma mai girman kai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="100"> Jesus Loved the People He Taught <br>
(trg)="98"> Yesu Ya Yi Ƙaunar Mutane da Ya Koyar da Su <br>
<hr>
(src)="101"> How did Jesus show that he did not want his followers to feel intimidated by him ? <br>
(trg)="99"> Ta yaya Yesu ya nuna cewa ba ya son mabiyansa su ji tsoronsa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="102"> Jesus ’ deep love for people always showed through in his teaching . <br>
(trg)="100"> Ƙaunar da Yesu yake yi wa mutane tana bayyana kullum a koyarwarsa . <br>
