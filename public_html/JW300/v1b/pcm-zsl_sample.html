(trg)="36"> Yet , Jehovah gives a name or a designation to each star . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Wetin this one teach us ? <br>
(trg)="37"> The lesson for us ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> Stars no get life , but Jehovah put dem for mind . <br>
(src)="55"> But you get life , and you dey serve Jehovah because you love am , no be because dem force you . <br>
(trg)="38"> If Jehovah takes a personal interest in his inanimate creation , imagine how he feels about you who serve him , not because you have been programmed to do so , but because you love him ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> So you no think sey Jehovah go still get you for mind ? <br>
