(trg)="10"> Yehova wādi wisamba na Yesu , umulombola milangwe ne mwiivwanino wandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> The apostle Paul speaks of ‘ the tongues of angels , ’ a heavenly form of communication superior to human language . ​ — 1 Cor . <br>
(src)="11"> 13 : 1 . <br>
(trg)="11"> Mutumibwa Polo unena nandi amba , bamwikeulu besambanga ludimi lwishile na lwa bantu . ​ — 1 Kodinda 13 : 1 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> Jehovah has intimate knowledge of billions of intelligent creatures , earthly and heavenly . <br>
(trg)="12"> Yehova uyukile bintu byonso bitala midiyala ne midiyala ya bamwikeulu ne bantu bapangile . <br>
<hr>

(trg)="14"> Yehova byaivwananga milombelo yonso , kadi wisambanga na bamwikeulu ne kwibaludika . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> To accomplish this , his thoughts , language , and communication must be vastly superior to those of humans . <br>

(src)="16"> ( Read Isaiah 55 : 8 , 9 . ) <br>
(trg)="16"> ( Tanga Isaya 55 : 8 , 9 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Clearly , when Jehovah communicates with humans , he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts so that man can understand them . <br>
(trg)="17"> O mwanda kitatyi kisamba Yehova na bantu , upēlejanga muneneno mu muswelo obabwanya kwivwana . <br>

(trg)="18"> Mu kino kishinte tusa kumona’mo muswelo mupotoloke wisambanga Yehova na bantu . <br>

(trg)="22"> Yehova pāesambile na Adama muntu mubajinji , mu budimi bwa Edena bimweka bu wādi wisamba nandi mu Kihebelu kya kala . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> God likely did so in an ancient form of Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="23"> Mwenda mafuku , Yehova wēsambile na bana - balume pamo bwa Mosesa , Samwele ne Davida . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> He later made his thoughts known to Hebrew - speaking Bible writers , such as Moses , Samuel , and David , and they expressed these thoughts in their own words and style . <br>
(trg)="24"> Nansha byōbasonekele binenwa byabo mu Kihebelu kadi mu mineneno mishileshile , ino bālembele enka milangwe ya Leza . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> Besides recording direct statements from God , they told of his dealings with his people , including accounts of their faith and love as well as those that revealed their failings and unfaithfulness . <br>
(trg)="25"> Bāsonekele myanda yādi itamba kudi Yehova ne mānga ya kipwano kya Leza na bantu bandi . <br>

(trg)="27"> Ino myanda yonso i misonekwe mwanda wa kamweno ketu . ​ — Loma 15 : 4 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> Did Jehovah insist that his people use only Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="28"> Le Kihebelu lo ludimi lumo kete lwisambanga Yehova na bantu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Explain . <br>
(trg)="29"> Shintulula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> As circumstances changed , God did not restrict his communication with humans to Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="30"> Yehova kesambangapo nyeke na bantu enka mu Kihebelu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> After the Babylonian exile , Aramaic became the everyday language of some of God’s people . <br>
(trg)="31"> Kitatyi kyānyongolwelwe bene Isalela mu bupika mu Babiloni , bamo bādi besamba difuku ne difuku Kialamia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Perhaps to indicate what was to come , Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic . ​ — See the footnotes to Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>
(trg)="32"> O mwanda ba Danyele , Yelemia ne Ezela bāsonekele bipindi bimo bya Bible mu Kialamia . ​ — Tala kunshi kwa dyani mu Bible wa Falanse mu Ezela 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Yelemia 10 : 11 ; ne Danyele 2 : 4 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> How did God’s Word become available in languages other than Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="33"> Mwanda waka Bisonekwa bya Kihebelu byaālamwinwe mu Kingidiki ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Alexander the Great later conquered much of the ancient world , and common , or Koine , Greek became an international language . <br>
(trg)="34"> Mwenda mafuku , Alekizandele Mukatampe wanekenye kipindi kikatampe kya ntanda , kadi Kingidiki kya dyalelo kitwa ne bu Koine kyaikala ke ludimi lwisambwa mu matanda mavule . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Many Jews began to speak that language , leading to the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek . <br>
(trg)="35"> Bayuda bavule bāshilula kwisamba Kingidiki , kadi Bisonekwa bya Kihebelu byaālamunwa mu Kingidiki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> This translation , thought to have been done by 72 translators , became known as the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="38"> Bashayuka banenanga’mba Bible wa Septante wavuilwe kwalamunwa na balamuni 72 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> Septuagint means “ Seventy . ” <br>
(trg)="39"> * ( Tala kunshi kwa dyani . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> Translation reportedly began in Egypt in the third century B.C.E . and may have been finished by 150 B.C.E . <br>
(trg)="40"> Bilembwa bimo byadi byalamunwa kishima ne kishima ku Bisonekwa bya Kihebelu , bikwabo nabyo mpika . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> This translation is still important , as it gives scholars insight into the meaning of certain obscure Hebrew words and passages . <br>
(trg)="41"> Ino Bayuda bādi besamba Kingidiki ne bene Kidishitu bādi bakulupile amba Bible wa Septante i Kinenwa kya Leza . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> The work of so many translators resulted in varied translation styles , from literal to rather free . <br>
(trg)="42"> Lelo Yesu wādi ufundija bana bandi ba bwanga mu ludimi’ka ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Nevertheless , the Septuagint was viewed as God’s Word by Greek - speaking Jews and later by Christians . <br>
(trg)="43"> Yesu paādi pano pa ntanda , bimweka padi bu wādi wisamba Kihebelu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> When God’s firstborn came to earth , he likely spoke and taught in what the Bible calls Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="44"> Pakwabo wādi wisamba Kialamia kya mu mene mafuku’a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(src)="47"> However , he also knew the ancient Hebrew of Moses and the prophets , which was read each week in the synagogues . <br>
(trg)="45"> Inoko kadi wādi uyukile Kihebelu kya kala kyādi kīsamba Mosesa ne bapolofeto , bene bāsonekele bilembwa byādi bitangwa yenga ne yenga mu mashinankonka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> In addition , Greek and Latin were spoken in Israel . <br>
(src)="49"> The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages . <br>
(trg)="46"> Kadi nansha Kingidiki ne Kilateni byobyādi bīsambwa mu kitatyi kya Yesu , i kutupu palombwele Bible amba Yesu nandi wesambile ino ndimi . <br>
(trg)="47"> 8 , 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>
(trg)="48"> Mwanda waka bene Kidishitu bavule bādi besamba Kingidiki ne kino kitufundija bika padi Yehova ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Jesus ’ early followers knew Hebrew , but after his death , his disciples spoke other languages . <br>
(trg)="49"> Balondi babajinji ba Yesu bādi besamba Kihebelu , ino Yesu pa kufwa , bashilula kwīsamba ndimi mikwabo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>
(trg)="50"> ( Tanga Bilongwa 6 : 1 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="51"> Pādi penda pazambalala myanda miyampe , bene Kidishitu bavule bashilula kwisamba Kingidiki bininge kupita’ko Kihebelu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="52"> Mwanda Kingidiki lwāikele bu ludimi lwisambwa na bavule , mikanda ya Mateo , Mako , Luka ne Yoano yaābanibwe mu Kingidiki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Thus , the language of many disciples was Greek rather than Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="53"> * ( Tala kunshi kwa dyani . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="54"> Ne kadi mikanda ya mutumibwa Polo ne mikanda mikwabo ya mu Bible yāsonekelwe mu Kingidiki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(src)="58"> What does this indicate about Jehovah ? <br>
(trg)="55"> Kino kisangaja pa kuyuka amba balembi ba Bisonekwa bya bwine Kidishitu bya Kingidiki bapitulukile mu Bisonekwa bya Kihebelu divule dine na kwingidija Bible wa Septante . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="56"> Mu kino kitatyi , bino binenwa byapitulukilwe’mo byāpēleje bishima bya Kihebelu kibajinjibajinji . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> These quotations , which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording , are now part of the inspired Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="57"> O mwanda uno mwingilo wa balamuni ba kubulwa kubwaninina i mubunde kipindi kya Bible otudi nandi dyalelo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="58"> Kino kitufundija amba Yehova kamonengapo ludimi lumo nansha kibidiji kimo bu bipite bikwabo . ​ — Tanga Bilongwa 10 : 34 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="59"> Le i bika byotwamona pa muswelo wisambanga Yehova na bantu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Our brief review of God’s communication with humans teaches us that Jehovah communicates according to need and circumstances . <br>
(trg)="60"> Tubamonenga amba Yehova wisambanga na bantu mungya ngikadilo palapala . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>
(trg)="61"> Ketulombengapo kwisamba ludimi kamukaya pa kuyuka mpango yandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> ( Read Zechariah 8 : 23 ; Revelation 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
(trg)="62"> ( Tanga Zekadia 8 : 23 ; Kusokwelwa 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Jehovah directed the inspiration of the Bible , but he allowed it to be presented in different styles . <br>
(trg)="63"> Kadi tubamonenga amba Yehova wāpēle balembi ba Bible bukomo bwa mushipiditu , ino wēbalekele basoneke milangwe yandi mu byabo bishima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> Why have language differences not hindered God’s communication with people ? <br>
(trg)="64"> Mwanda waka kwisamba kwisambanga bantu ndimi mishileshile kekukambakanyangapo Yehova ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> Has God’s communication with humans been hindered by the use of different languages and minor variations in translation ? <br>
(src)="69"> No . <br>
(trg)="65"> Bantu besambanga ndimi mishileshile , inoko kino kekikambakanyangapo Yehova . <br>
(trg)="66"> Le tubayuka kino namani ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> For example , we may be aware of only a few of the original - language words that Jesus used . <br>
(trg)="67"> Mu Bible mudi’tu binenwa bityetye byesambile Yesu bya mu ludimi lubajinjibajinji . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> However , Jehovah made sure that Jesus ’ message was transmitted in Greek and , in time , in other languages . <br>
(trg)="68"> Inoko Yehova wāsakile amba musapu wa Yesu usonekwe ne kwalamunwa mu Kingidiki ebiya ke mu ndimi mikwabo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> Later , Bible manuscripts were copied again and again by Jews and Christians , preserving the holy writings . <br>
(trg)="69"> Kadi , musapu wa Leza wālaminwe mwanda Kinenwa kya Leza kyādi kitentulwa kitatyi ne kitatyi na Bayuda ne bene Kidishitu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> These were translated into many more languages . <br>
(trg)="70"> Ino mikanda yaālamwinwe mu ndimi mivule mine . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> John Chrysostom of the fourth / ​ fifth century C.E . said that by his day , Jesus ’ teachings had been translated into the languages of the Syrians , Egyptians , Indians , Persians , Ethiopians , and innumerable other peoples . <br>
(trg)="71"> Kintu kya myaka 400 na pādi Yesu pano pa ntanda , John Chrysostom wanene amba bufundiji bwa Yesu bwaalamwinwe mu ndimi ya bene Shidea , bene Edipito , bene India , bene Peleshia , bene Efiopya ne ya mu bantu bakwabo bavule . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> How was the transmission of the Bible opposed ? <br>
(trg)="72"> Lelo Bible watambilwe namani ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Producing the Bible in many languages thwarted the efforts of such men as Roman Emperor Diocletian , who in 303 C.E . ordered that all copies of the Scriptures be destroyed . <br>
(trg)="73"> Kukwatañana na mānga , kwadi kutambwa kwa Bible ne bene badi balamuna’ye ne kwabanya’ye . <br>
(trg)="74"> Kintu kya myaka 300 kupwa kwa Yesu kubutulwa , Diocletian Mbikavu wa Loma wāsoñanya konakanya mikanda yonso ya Bible . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> There were countless attacks on God’s Word and on those who translated and distributed it . <br>
(trg)="75"> Kintu kya myaka 1200 pa kupita’po , William Tyndale washilula kwalamuna Bible mu Angele . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> In the 16th century , William Tyndale set out to translate the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into English , declaring to a well - educated man : “ If God spare my life , ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the Scripture than thou doest . ” <br>
(trg)="76"> Wanena amba shi Leza a mubweje’ko mafuku mavule , nansha ke kanuke katyetye kakayuka Bible biyampe kupita’ko kitobo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> Tyndale had to flee from England to the European continent to translate and print his translation . <br>
(trg)="77"> Mwanda wa kupangwapangwa , Tyndale wanyemene mu Angeletele mu Bulaya na mulangwe wa kwalamuna ne kutampa Bible . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Despite a campaign by the clergy to burn publicly all the Bibles that they could find , copies began to circulate in great numbers . <br>
(trg)="78"> Nansha bendeji ba bipwilo pobasokele mikanda yonso yobadi batana , bwalamuni bwa Tyndale bwaabanibwe ku bantu bavule . <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> Eventually , Tyndale was betrayed and was strangled and burned at the stake , but his Bible translation lived on . <br>
(trg)="79"> Bine , Tyndale wayeyekelwe ku mutyi ne kusokwa’ye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> It was consulted extensively in the preparation of the widely distributed King James version of the Bible . ​ — Read 2 Timothy 2 : 9 . <br>
(trg)="80"> Ino bwalamuni bwandi bwalaminwe ku kutambwa kwa bendeji ba bipwilo , kadi bwaingidijibwe pa kuteakananya bwalamuni bwa Bible bwitwa bu King James Version . ​ — Tanga 2 Temote 2 : 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> What has the study of ancient manuscripts shown ? <br>
(trg)="81"> Lelo bwifundi bwa bilembwa bya Bible wa pa kala bulombola bika ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> Granted , some surviving ancient copies of the Bible contain minor mistakes and discrepancies . <br>
(trg)="82"> Bine , mu mikanda imo ya mu Bible wa kala mudi tubilubo tutyetutye twishileshile . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> However , thousands of fragments , manuscripts , and ancient translations have been compared and painstakingly studied by Bible scholars . <br>
(trg)="83"> Inoko , bashayuka befundile na katentekeji tununu twa Bilembwa , ne bipindi bya mu bino bilembwa ne malamuni a kala a Bible . <br>

(trg)="84"> Pa kupwa kwibidingakanya , bamwene amba mudi’tu mavese matyetye meshile bityē , ne kadi pa tumyanda tutyetye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> The few verses about which there is a degree of uncertainty do not change the overall message . <br>
(trg)="85"> Ino musapu wa Bible kewashintyilepo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> A study of ancient manuscripts convinces sincere Bible students that they have what Jehovah originally inspired Bible writers to record . ​ — Isa . <br>

(trg)="86"> Buno bwifundi i bukulupije bya bine befundi ba Bible amba Bible obadi nandi dyalelo i Kinenwa kya Yehova kya ku bukomo bwa mushipiditu . ​ — Isaya 40 : 8 . <br>

(src)="92"> Even at a time when many have little or no faith in God , the Bible remains a best seller and is now available , in whole or in part , in over 2,800 languages . <br>
(trg)="89"> Nansha bantu bavule byobadi balwa Bible , pano i mwalamunwe mu ndimi 2 800 ne kupita . <br>

(trg)="97"> Inoko dyalelo , mabuku etu esambila pa Bible alupulwanga mu ndimi 700 ne kupita . <br>
<hr>
