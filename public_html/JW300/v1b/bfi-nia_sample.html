(trg)="22"> ( Baso Yesaya 55 : 8 , 9 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Clearly , when Jehovah communicates with humans , he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts so that man can understand them . <br>
(trg)="23"> Tobali , ba ginötö fahuhuo ia ba niha , iʼogunaʼö wehede salio muʼila eluaha . <br>

(trg)="24"> Ba duho daʼa , tafahaʼö ita hewisa lala wahuhuosa Yehowa ba niha gulidanö . <br>

(trg)="28"> Me fahuhuo Yehowa khö Gadamo ba kabu Edena , tola manö li Heberaiʼo meföna niʼogunaʼönia . <br>

(trg)="29"> Aefa daʼö , fahuhuo Yehowa khö Moze , khö Zamueli , khö Dawido , ba lasura fefu niwaʼö Yehowa ba li Heberaiʼo . <br>

<hr>
(src)="29"> Did Jehovah insist that his people use only Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="35"> Hadia ha li Heberaiʼo niʼogunaʼö Lowalangi na fahuhuo ia ba niha ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Explain . <br>
(trg)="36"> Tutunö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> As circumstances changed , God did not restrict his communication with humans to Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="37"> Tenga li Heberaiʼo manö niʼogunaʼö Yehowa na fahuhuo ia ba niha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> After the Babylonian exile , Aramaic became the everyday language of some of God’s people . <br>
(trg)="38"> Me teʼefaʼö ndraono Gizaraʼeli moroi ba Mbabilona , so ba gotaluara zangogunaʼö li Garamo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Perhaps to indicate what was to come , Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic . ​ — See the footnotes to Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>
(trg)="39"> Te daʼö mbörö wa lasura ösa nösi Zura Niʼamoniʼö ba li Garamo ira Danieli , Yeremia , ba Gesera . — Gese . <br>

(src)="34"> How did God’s Word become available in languages other than Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="41"> Hadia mbörö wa lafoʼeluaha Gamabuʼula Li si Föföna ba li ndrawa Heleni ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Alexander the Great later conquered much of the ancient world , and common , or Koine , Greek became an international language . <br>
(trg)="42"> Oya ikalaisi soi Alexander Agung . <br>
(trg)="43"> Yaʼia andre moroi ba ndrawa Heleni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Many Jews began to speak that language , leading to the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek . <br>
(trg)="44"> Börö daʼö , oya soi zangogunaʼö li ndrawa Heleni nifotöi Koine . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> This translation , thought to have been done by 72 translators , became known as the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="45"> Ato niha Yehuda sangogunaʼö li ndrawa Heleni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> It was the first translation of the Bible and one of the most important . <br>
(src)="39"> Septuagint means “ Seventy . ” <br>
(trg)="46"> Andrö , lafoʼeluaha Gamabuʼula Li si Föföna ba li ndrawa Heleni , lafotöi ia Septuaginta . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> Translation reportedly began in Egypt in the third century B.C.E . and may have been finished by 150 B.C.E . <br>
(trg)="47"> Daʼö Zura Niʼamoniʼö si oföna sibai lafoʼeluaha ba laʼogunaʼö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> This translation is still important , as it gives scholars insight into the meaning of certain obscure Hebrew words and passages . <br>
(trg)="48"> Faduhu dödö niha sagatua - tua wa so 72 niha samoʼeluaha Septuaginta andrö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> The work of so many translators resulted in varied translation styles , from literal to rather free . <br>
(trg)="49"> * So ösa zangosisiʼö ngawua wehede moroi ba Gamabuʼula Li si Föföna ba wamoʼeluaha yaʼia , so göi zi löʼö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Nevertheless , the Septuagint was viewed as God’s Word by Greek - speaking Jews and later by Christians . <br>
(trg)="50"> Faduhu dödö niha Yehuda hegöi niha Keriso sangogunaʼö li ndrawa Heleni wa Septuaginta andrö no fehede Lowalangi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> What language did Jesus likely use to teach his disciples ? <br>
(trg)="51"> Hadia li niʼogunaʼö Yesu me ifahaʼö ndra nifahaʼönia ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> When God’s firstborn came to earth , he likely spoke and taught in what the Bible calls Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="52"> Tola manö li Heberaiʼo niʼogunaʼö Yesu me so ia ba gulidanö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(trg)="53"> Tola göi iʼogunaʼö li Garamo sasese laʼogunaʼö niha me luo daʼö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> However , he also knew the ancient Hebrew of Moses and the prophets , which was read each week in the synagogues . <br>
(trg)="54"> Iʼila Yesu li Heberaiʼo niʼogunaʼö Moze hegöi ndra samaʼeleʼö tanö böʼö , ba ero migu ibaso zura nisurara ba gosali . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> In addition , Greek and Latin were spoken in Israel . <br>
(trg)="55"> Hewaʼae li ndrawa Heleni hegöi li Latin niʼogunaʼö me luo daʼö , lö ifatunö Sura Niʼamoniʼö wa iʼogunaʼö Yesu li tanö böʼö . <br>
(trg)="56"> 8 , 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages . <br>
(trg)="57"> Hadia mbörö wa ato niha Keriso zangogunaʼö li ndrawa Heleni , ba hadia wamahaʼö khöda sanandrösa khö Yehowa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>
(trg)="58"> Li Heberaiʼo niʼogunaʼö ndra nifahaʼö Yesu meföna . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Jesus ’ early followers knew Hebrew , but after his death , his disciples spoke other languages . <br>
(trg)="59"> Hizaʼi , me no aefa mate ia , laʼogunaʼö li tanö böʼö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>
(trg)="60"> ( Baso Halöwö Zinenge 6 : 1 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="61"> Me teturiaigö duria somuso dödö , ato niha Keriso zangogunaʼö li ndrawa Heleni moroi na laʼogunaʼö li Heberaiʼo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(src)="55"> Thus , the language of many disciples was Greek rather than Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="62"> Börö me li ndrawa Heleni zasese muʼogunaʼö me luo daʼö , andrö wa musura mbuku Mataiʼo , Mareko , Luka , ba Yohane ba li ndrawa Heleni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="63"> * Simanö göi nisura Waulo hegöi buku tanö böʼö lasura ba li ndrawa Heleni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(trg)="64"> Asese laʼogunaʼö Septuaginta sanura Gamabuʼula Li si Bohou me lahalö ngawua wehede Gamabuʼula Li si Föföna . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="65"> Ngawua wehede nihalöra andrö faböʼö maʼifu moroi ba li Heberaiʼo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> These quotations , which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording , are now part of the inspired Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="66"> Irugi iadaʼa , no taʼogunaʼö Zura Niʼamoniʼö nifoʼeluahara hewaʼae lö moʼahonoa ira . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="67"> Daʼa zamomaha yaʼita wa lö faböʼö - böʼö wamaigi Yehowa li mazui si toʼölö mufalua ba zi sambu - sambua banua . — Baso Halöwö Zinenge 10 : 34 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="68"> Hadia zaboto ba dödöda sanandrösa ba wahuhuosa Yehowa ba niha ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Our brief review of God’s communication with humans teaches us that Jehovah communicates according to need and circumstances . <br>
(trg)="69"> No tafahaʼö ita hewisa wofaudugö Yehowa wahuhuosania ba niha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>
(trg)="70"> Lö nitatugöinia hadia li zinangea taʼogunaʼö enaʼö aboto ba dödöda gohitö dödönia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> ( Read Zechariah 8 : 23 ; Revelation 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
(trg)="71"> ( Baso Zakharia 8 : 23 ; Famaʼeleʼö 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Jehovah directed the inspiration of the Bible , but he allowed it to be presented in different styles . <br>
(trg)="72"> Aboto göi ba dödöda wa no ibeʼe gehehania Yehowa ba niha wanura Sura Niʼamoniʼö , hizaʼi itehegö khöra wanura moloʼö lagu wehedera samösa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> Why have language differences not hindered God’s communication with people ? <br>
(trg)="73"> Hana wa lö fasala khö Yehowa na oya li niʼogunaʼö niha gulidanö ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> Has God’s communication with humans been hindered by the use of different languages and minor variations in translation ? <br>
(trg)="74"> Hewaʼae oya li niʼogunaʼö niha gulidanö , lö fasala khö Yehowa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> No . <br>
(trg)="75"> Hana wa taʼila ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> For example , we may be aware of only a few of the original - language words that Jesus used . <br>
(trg)="76"> Ba Zura Niʼamoniʼö , lö oya li Heberaiʼo niʼogunaʼö Yesu me so ia ba gulidanö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> However , Jehovah made sure that Jesus ’ message was transmitted in Greek and , in time , in other languages . <br>
(trg)="77"> Hizaʼi , omasi Yehowa na musura ba mufoʼeluaha ngawua wehede Yesu ba li ndrawa Heleni mazui ba li tanö böʼö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> Later , Bible manuscripts were copied again and again by Jews and Christians , preserving the holy writings . <br>
(trg)="78"> No terorogö Daromali Lowalangi börö me no hauga kali lasura ia ira niha Yehuda hegöi niha Keriso ba lafoʼeluaha ba li tanö böʼö . <br>

<hr>
(src)="74"> John Chrysostom of the fourth / ​ fifth century C.E . said that by his day , Jesus ’ teachings had been translated into the languages of the Syrians , Egyptians , Indians , Persians , Ethiopians , and innumerable other peoples . <br>
(trg)="80"> Hadia nifalua niha enaʼö lö tetehegö tefazaewe Zura Niʼamoniʼö ? <br>

(trg)="82"> So mato 300 fakhe me no aefa tumbu Yesu , ibeʼe goroisa Samatörö Roma sotöi Diokletianus ba wamakiko Sura Niʼamoniʼö si no mufoʼeluaha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Producing the Bible in many languages thwarted the efforts of such men as Roman Emperor Diocletian , who in 303 C.E . ordered that all copies of the Scriptures be destroyed . <br>
(trg)="83"> 1.200 fakhe aefa daʼö , ibörötaigö ifoʼeluaha Zura Niʼamoniʼö William Tyndale ba li Inggris . <br>

(src)="77"> There were countless attacks on God’s Word and on those who translated and distributed it . <br>

<hr>
(src)="78"> In the 16th century , William Tyndale set out to translate the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into English , declaring to a well - educated man : “ If God spare my life , ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the Scripture than thou doest . ” <br>
(trg)="85"> Börö me so wolohi , moloi Tyndale moroi ba Inggris numalö ba Eropa ba wamoʼeluaha hegöi ba wamazökhi Sura Niʼamoniʼö . <br>

(trg)="86"> Ira sondröniaʼö ba agama laʼodödögö wangalui hegöi ba wotunu Sura Niʼamoniʼö . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Despite a campaign by the clergy to burn publicly all the Bibles that they could find , copies began to circulate in great numbers . <br>
(trg)="87"> Hewaʼae simanö , Sura Niʼamoniʼö nifoʼeluaha Tyndale no tefazaewe ba niha . <br>

(src)="81"> Eventually , Tyndale was betrayed and was strangled and burned at the stake , but his Bible translation lived on . <br>
(trg)="88"> Ba gafuriatania , latögi mbagi Tyndale ba latunu ia ba döla geu . <br>

(src)="82"> It was consulted extensively in the preparation of the widely distributed King James version of the Bible . ​ — Read 2 Timothy 2 : 9 . <br>

(src)="83"> What has the study of ancient manuscripts shown ? <br>
(trg)="90"> Hadia mbuania me no lafahaʼö ira ba manuskrip Zura Niʼamoniʼö si föföna ? <br>
