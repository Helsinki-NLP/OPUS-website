(trg)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Abashimika ili lyashi ni ba Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> Mu 1975 , ninshi ndi ne myaka ibili , e lyo bamayo bamwene ukuti nalikwete ubwafya . <br>
(trg)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> Bamayo balimwene ukuti nshaumfwile nangu panono ukuti kwali icaponene icapangile icongo pantu nshasakenye no kusakanya . <br>
(trg)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Nasukile na kumanya ne myaka itatu , ukwabula ukuti ntendeke ukulanda . <br>
(trg)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> Lyena bushiku bumo balupwa lwandi balibebele ilyashi ilya baponeshe pa musao . <br>
(trg)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Badokota babele ukuti nali nkomamatwi ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Ilyo nali fye umwaice , batata na bamayo ifyupo fyalipwile kabili bamayo e batendeke ukulasunga ine na bakalamba bandi babili abaume e lyo na bankashi yandi bamo . <br>
(trg)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Pali ilya nshita bankomamatwi abengi mu France tabalesambilila sana nga fintu caba pali ino nshita , kabili inshila balebasambilishishamo limo yalelenga balecula sana . <br>
(trg)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> Na lyo line , ukufuma fye na ku bwaice ine nalikwata ishuko ilyo bankomamatwi abengi bashakwata . <br>
(trg)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Lekeni imishimikile ifyo cali . <br>
(trg)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> Pa myaka iingi bakafundisha abengi baletontonkanya ukuti inshila ya kusambilishishamo bankomamatwi iingabomba bwino , kulabeba ukulolesha bakafundisha pa kanwa no kwesha ukwiluka ifyo balelanda . <br>
(trg)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Na kuba , ku France uko nakuliile , balibindile ukubomfya ululimi lwa bankomamatwi mu masukulu . <br>
(trg)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Bankomamatwi bamo balebakakila fye na maboko ku numa nga balesambilila . <br>
(trg)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Ilyo nali umwaice , kwali abaishibe sana ifya kusambilisha abashilanda abaleisa mu kunsambilisha pa ma - awala ayengi cila mulungu . <br>
(trg)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> Balenjikata umubango nelyo umutwe kabili balenjeba ukulanda imiku iingi ifyo nshaleumfwa . <br>
(trg)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Nalefilwa ukulanda na baice banandi . <br>
(trg)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Ala naliculile icibi ! <br>
(trg)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Ilyo nali ne myaka 6 , bantwele kwi sukulu lya bankomamatwi uko naile mu kusambilila . <br>
(trg)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Uyu wali e muku wa kubalilapo ukuba na bakomamatwi banandi . <br>
(trg)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Kuli ili sukulu na ko tabalesuminisha ukulanda ululimi lwa bankomamatwi . <br>
(trg)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> Nga twabomfya ululimi lwa bankomamatwi baletuuma ku minwe nelyo ukututinta imishishi . <br>
(trg)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> Nangu cali ifi , twalebomfya ulu lulimi ukwabula ukuti batumone , ukubomfya ifishibilo ifyo twaipangile fye fwe bene . <br>
(trg)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> Nasukile natendeka ukulanshanya na bankomamatwi banandi . <br>
(trg)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Ici calengele ukuti pa myaka 4 iyakonkelepo imbe ne nsansa . <br>
(trg)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> Lelo ilyo nali ne myaka 10 , bantwele kwi sukulu ukwalesambilila abana abashali bankomamatwi . <br>
(trg)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> Ala calinkalipe ! <br>
(trg)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Nalemona fye kwati bankomamatwi bonse balifwile kabili nashele fye neka mu calo . <br>
(trg)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> Pa mulandu wa fyo badokota abaishibe sana ifya kusambilisha ukulanda baebele balupwa lwandi ukuti nga basambilila ululimi lwa bankomamatwi ninshi nshakeshibe ukulanda , calengele ukuti besambilila ulu ululimi kabili balenkanya ukwangala na bankomamatwi . <br>
(trg)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Bushiku bumo ilyo naile mu kumona dokota uwaishibe sana ifya kusambilisha ukulanda , nasangile nabika icitabo ca kusambililamo ululimi lwa bankomamatwi pe tebulo lyakwe . <br>
(trg)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Ala nshakalabe ifyacitike ! <br>
(trg)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> Ilyo namwene ifikope pa nkupo ya ici icitabo , nasontele apali icitabo no kumweba ukuti “ tumoneni ici citabo ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Mukwangufyanya dokota alifishile cilya citabo . <br>
(trg)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> * <br>
(trg)="35"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> Bamayo lyonse bale - esha ukutusambilisha ukukonka ifyaba mu Baibolo . <br>
(trg)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> Baletusenda ku kulongana kwa Nte sha kwa Yehova mu Cilonganino ca Mérignac mupepi na ku Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> Apo nali umwaice , nshaleumfwa ifingi ifyo twalesambilila mu kulongana . <br>
(trg)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> Nangu cibe ifyo , aba mu cilonganino abalekanalekana baletemwa ukwikala na ine mu kulongana kabili balenembela ne fyo tulesambilila pali ubo ubushiku . <br>
(trg)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> Nalitemenwe sana ifyo bantemenwe ne fyo balembikako amano . <br>
(trg)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Bamayo balensambilisha Baibolo , lelo nshaleumfwikisha ifyo balensambilisha . <br>
(trg)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Naleyumfwa nga filya kasesema Daniel ayumfwile ilyo malaika amwebele ubusesemo . <br>
(src)="45"> Atile : “ Nalyumfwile , lelo nshailwike . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Lelo ine kuti natila “ Nalimwene , lelo nshailwike . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> Nangu cibe ifyo , mu kupita kwa nshita natendeke ukwishiba icine ca mu Baibolo . <br>
(trg)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Nalitemenwe ifyo nalesambilila kabili natampile ukufibomfya . <br>
(trg)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> Nalesambililako na ku fyo bambi balecita . <br>
(trg)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Ku ca kumwenako Baibolo itweba ukuti tufwile ukuba abatekanya . <br>
(trg)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Nshaishibe ifya kuba uwatekanya . <br>
(trg)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> Lelo ilyo nalemona ifyo abo twalelongana na bo bali abatekanya , e lyo naumfwikishe ifyo umuntu uwatekanya aba . <br>
(trg)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Ukwabula no kutwishika , aba mu cilonganino ca Bwina Kristu balingafwa sana . <br>
(trg)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> NALYUMFWILE UBUBI LELO PA NUMA NALITEMENWE <br>
(trg)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Bushiku bumo ninshi ndi fye umusepela , nalimwene abaice bankomamatwi balelanda ukubomfya iminwe . <br>
(trg)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> Natendeke ukwangala na bo mu bumfinsolo kabili natampile ukusambilila ululimi lwa bankomamatwi ulwa ciFrench . <br>
(trg)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Nalitwalilile ukulaya ku kulongana kwa Bwina Kristu kabili nalitemwanene na Stéphane , Nte wacaice . <br>
(trg)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Ale - esha sana ukulanshanya na ine kabili nalimutemenwe sana . <br>
(trg)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> Nangu cibe fyo , kwali icacitike icanengele ukumfwa ububi . <br>
(trg)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Stéphane balimukakile pa mulandu wa kukaana ukwingila ubushilika . <br>
(trg)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Nalyumfwile ububi sana ! <br>
(trg)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Ilyo bamukakile , nalifuupwilwe icine icine ica kuti kwashele fye kwempe , nga nalilekele ukulongana . <br>
(trg)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Pa numa ya myeshi 11 , Stéphane balimufumishe mu cifungo kabili alibwelele ku ng’anda . <br>
(trg)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> Ala nalipapile nga nshi ilyo namwene alelanda na ine mu lulimi lwa bankomamatwi ! <br>
(trg)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> Nalipapile sana ukusanga ukuti alishibe ululimi lwa bankomamatwi ulwa ciFrench . <br>
(trg)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane asambilile ulu ululimi ilyo ali mu cifungo . <br>
(trg)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> Ilyo namwene ifyo Stéphane alebomfya amaboko ne fyo alecita pa menso pa kulanda ulu ululimi , nalitemenwe sana pantu nalishibe ukuti nomba twakulalanshanya bwino . <br>
(trg)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> NASUKA NAUMFWIKISHA ICINE ICABA MU BAIBOLO <br>
(trg)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> Stéphane atampile ukunsambilisha Baibolo kabili natampile ukukutuluka ifyo nasambilile kale mu Baibolo . <br>
(trg)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> Ilyo nali umwaice , nalitemenwe sana ukutamba ifikope fyali mu mpapulo shesu , kabili nalefwaya ukwishiba ubupusano bwaleba pa baleba pa fikope kabili nalesambilila sana ishi impapulo pa kutila ilyashi lyonse lyaikala sana mu mutwe . <br>
(trg)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Nalisambilile pali Abrahamu , “ umwana ” e lyo na pe “ bumba likalamba , ” lelo naishileishiba bwino ifyo ifi fyalepilibula ilyo nafisambilile mu lulimi lwa bankomamatwi . <br>
(trg)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> Naishilemona ukuti ulu e lulimi mfwile fye ukulabomfya pantu ifyo balensambilisha nalefyumfwikisha sana . <br>
(trg)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Apo nomba naleumfwikisha ifyo twalesambilila mu kulongana , nalitemenwe nga nshi ica kuti nalefwaisha ukwishibilapo na fimbi . <br>
(trg)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Ilyo natwalilile ukusambilila na Stéphane , naleya ndeishibilako ifya mu Baibolo kabili mu 1992 nali - ipeele kuli Yehova Lesa kabili nalibatishiwe . <br>
(trg)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> Nalisambilile ifingi muli Baibolo , lelo pa mulandu wa kuti ilyo nali umwaice nshalelanshanya sana na bambi , nshalelandalanda kabili nali uwa nsoni . <br>
(trg)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> IFYO NAPWISHISHE UMWENSO <br>
(src)="77"> Mu kuya kwa nshita , akalibumba nalimo aka bankomamatwi , kasankene na bankomamatwi ba mu cilonganino ca mwi tauni lya Pessac , ilyaba mu musumba wa Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> Aba muli ici cilonganino balingafwile ukulunduluka mu fya kwa Lesa . <br>
(trg)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> Nangu ca kuti ncili ndashupikwa pa kulanshanya na bantu , abanandi abashili bankomamatwi balengafwa sana ukumfwikisha fyonse ifyo twalesambilila . <br>
(trg)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Ba Gilles na bena mwabo ba Elodie bale - esha sana ukuti tulelanshanya na bo . <br>
(trg)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> Ilingi line pa numa ya kulongana balitemenwe ukunsenda ku kulya ifya kulya nelyo ukunwa kofi , ne ci calengele ukuti tube ifibusa . <br>
(trg)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> Ala cilawama ukuba na bantu abakonka ifyo Lesa afwaya ! <br>
(trg)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> Muli ici cine icilonganino e mo naishibene na Vanessa , umukashana uwayemba . <br>
(trg)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> Nalitemenwe Vanessa pantu alebika sana amano ku bantu kabili taali na kapatulula . <br>
(trg)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Taletontonkanya ukuti apo ndi nkomamatwi ninshi te kuti akwanishe ukulalanshanya na ine , lelo alemona ukuti e lyo e ngasambilila no kulanshanya na bankomamatwi . <br>
(trg)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> Nalimutemenwe icine cine kabili mu 2005 twalyupene . <br>
(trg)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> Nangu ca kuti ncili ndashupikwa ukulanshanya na bantu , Vanessa alingafwa ukupwisha umwenso e lyo no kwishiba ifya kulanshanya na bantu bwino . <br>
(trg)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> Ndatasha sana pa fyo antungilila ilyo ndesakamana ulupwa lwesu ! <br>
(trg)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> YEHOVA AMPEELA ISHUKO NA LIMBI <br>
(src)="90"> Mu 2005 ilyo twaupene , balinjitile ukuya mu kubombela ku maofeshi ya Nte sha kwa Yehova mu Louviers ku France . <br>
(trg)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Naile mu kusambilila umulimo wa kupilibula pa mweshi umo . <br>
(trg)="88"> In recent years the branch has been working very hard to produce several publications in FSL on DVD . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> Ababombela pa maofeshi ya Nte sha kwa Yehova mu France balebombesha ukupilibwila impapulo shesu mu lulimi lwa bankomamatwi ulwa mu ciFrench no kushibika pa DVD . <br>
(trg)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> Lelo apo imilimo yali no kufulilako , bakapilibula na bambi balefwaikwa . <br>

(trg)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> Twaleti , ni bani bakalasakamana ibumba lyesu ilya bankomamatwi ? <br>
(trg)="92"> What would happen to our sign - language group ? <br>

<hr>
(src)="99"> Nalimwene ukuti cine cine Yehova alitutemwa kabili alitemwa na bankomamatwi . <br>
