(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> Olivier Hamel anloa edwɛkɛ <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="3"> Wɔ 1975 ne anu mɔɔ ɛnee menyia ɛvolɛ nwiɔ la , me mame nwunle debie ɛzulolɛ bie wɔ me nwo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="4"> Mekɛ mɔɔ ɛnee me mame ɛdwu me la , ɔ gɔnwo bie dele debie kpole bie aze manle ɔyɛle dede . <br>

(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="5"> Me mame nwunle kɛ meanga me nwo bɔbɔ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="6"> Ɔkadwu ɛvolɛ nsa la , ɛnee mengola tendɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Akee me abusua ne dele amaneɛbɔlɛ mɔɔ yɛ azibɛnwo la — dɔketama hanle kɛ mele mumule ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>

<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="9"> Zɔhane mekɛ ne , ɛnee bɛmmaa ngakula mɔɔ le mumule wɔ France la ɛngɔ sukulu kɛmɔ bɛyɛ ye ɛnɛ la , yɛɛ ɔdwu mekɛ ne bie a , kɛzi bɛkile bɛ debie la maa bɛdi nyane . <br>

(trg)="12"> Mekɛ mɔɔ ɛnee meli ɛvolɛ kɛyɛ nnu la <br>

(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="14"> Nɔhalɛ nu , ɛleka mɔɔ menyinle wɔ France la , ɛnee bɛngile mumule aneɛ wɔ sukulu nu fee . <br>

(trg)="15"> Ɛnee bɛkyekye ngakula mɔɔ bɛle mumule la asa wɔ bɛ nzi wɔ mekɛ mɔɔ bɛlɛsukoa debie la . <br>

(trg)="16"> Mekɛ mɔɔ mɛlɛnyi la , ɛnee awie fa dɔnehwele dɔɔnwo kile me ɛdendɛlɛ dapɛne biala . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="17"> Ɛnee bɛsɔ me awudwelɛ anzɛɛ me ti na bɛmaa meka edwɛkɛ dɔɔnwo mɔɔ mende la . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="18"> Ɛnee mengola me nee ngakula gyɛne ɛndendɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="19"> Menwunle amaneɛ wɔ zɔhane mekɛ ne mɔ anu . <br>

(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>

(trg)="21"> Ɛhye a le mekɛ mɔɔ lumua mɔɔ me nee ngakula gyɛne mɔɔ bɛle mumule la dule a . <br>

(trg)="22"> Ɛkɛ ne noko , ɛnee bɛngile mumule aneɛ wɔ ɛkɛ . <br>

<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="24"> Noko akee , ɛnee yɛfea yɛfa yɛ sa yɛtendɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="25"> Awieleɛ bɔkɔɔ ne , ɛnee mekola me nee ngakula gyɛne tendɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="26"> Kɛ ɛvolɛ nna mɔɔ yɛ anyelielɛ la bɔle ɔ bo la ɛne . <br>

(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>

<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="28"> Me nwo bubule me ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="29"> Ɛnee medwenle kɛ ngakula mɔɔ le mumule la kɔsɔɔti ɛwu na yeha me ngomekye wɔ ewiade . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="30"> Dɔketama dule me abusua ne folɛ kɛ bɛfa mumule aneɛ bɛtendɛ bɛkile me a menrɛnwu tendɛ , yemɔti bɛanzukoa mumule aneɛ yɛɛ bɛammaa me nee ngakula mɔɔ bɛle mumule la andu . <br>

(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="31"> Mekakye kɛ mekɛ bie yɛhɔle dɔketa bie ɛkɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="32"> Ɛnee ɔlɛ mumule aneɛ buluku la ye ɛkponle ne azo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> Mekɛ mɔɔ menwunle nvoninli ne mɔɔ wɔ zolɛ la , mendendenle me sa wɔ zolɛ na menganle kɛ , “ Mekulo buluku ɛhye ! ” <br>

<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="36"> Me mame bɔle mɔdenle vale Keleseɛne ngyinlazo tetele yɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="37"> Ɛnee ɔ nee yɛ kɔ debiezukoalɛ wɔ Mérignac Gyihova Alasevolɛ Asafo ne mɔɔ bikye Bordeaux la . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="38"> Kɛmɔ mele kakula la ati , ɛnee mende ninyɛne mɔɔ bɛsukoa la abo kpalɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="39"> Noko akee , ɛnee menli mɔɔ wɔ ɛkɛ la batɛnla me nwo ɛkɛ na bɛkɛlɛ mɔɔ bɛlɛka la bɛkile me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="40"> Kɛzi bɛlɛ ɛlɔlɛ na bɛdwenle me nwo la hanle me kpalɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="41"> Me Mame nee me zukoale Baebolo ne wɔ sua nu , noko ɛnee mende mɔɔ ɔlɛkile me la abo kpalɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> Mendele nganeɛ kɛ ngapezonli Daneɛle , wɔ mekɛ mɔɔ anwumabɔvolɛ bie hanle ngapezo edwɛkɛ hilele ye la , ɔhanle kɛ : “ Mendele edwɛkɛ ɛhye , na meande ɔ bo . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> ( Daneɛle 12 : 8 ) Wɔ me afoa nu , “ Menwunle ye , noko meande ɔ bo . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="44"> Noko akee , menwunle Baebolo ne anu nɔhalɛ ne ngyikyi ngyikyi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="45"> Me nye liele mɔɔ mendele ɔ bo wienyi la anwo na membɔle mɔdenle menvale membɔle me ɛbɛla . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="46"> Eza , menzukoale kɛzi awie mɔ bɔ bɛ ɛbɛla la . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="47"> Kɛ neazo la , Baebolo ne ka kɛ yɛzi abotane . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="48"> Ɛnee mende mɔɔ ɔkile la abo kpalɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="49"> Noko akee , mekɛ mɔɔ menwunle kɛzi me gɔnwo mɔ mediema ɛlɛda subane ɛhye ali la , mendele mɔɔ abotane kile la abo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="50"> Nɔhalɛ nu , Keleseɛne asafo ne ɛboa me kpole kpalɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="51"> Stéphane boale me manle mendele Baebolo ne abo <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="52"> Mekɛ mɔɔ melɛnyi la , kenle ko bie menwunle kɛ mgbavolɛ bie ɛlɛfa mumule aneɛ adendɛ ahile bɛ nwo wɔ gua zo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="53"> Membɔle ɔ bo kɛ me nee bɛ tu wɔ fealera nu na menzukoale France Mumule Aneɛ ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="54"> Mendoale zo mengɔle Keleseɛne nyianu na Dasevolɛ kpavolɛ ko , mɔɔ bɛfɛlɛ ye Stéphane la boale me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="55"> Ɔbɔle mɔdenle biala kɛ ɔ nee me badendɛ , na ɔmanle me nye liele ɔ nwo kpalɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="56"> Noko , me rɛle bɔle kpole . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="57"> Kɛmɔ Stéphane le Keleseɛnenli mɔɔ ɔngyi afoa biala la ati bɛdole ye efiade . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="58"> Me nwo bubule me ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="59"> Stéphane hɔle la , me rɛle bɔle na mengɔ debiezukoalɛ kpalɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="60"> Siane 11 anzi , bɛyele Stéphane na ɔrale sua nu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="61"> Nea kɛzi ɔzinle me nwo wɔ mekɛ mɔɔ Stéphane bɔle ɔ bo kɛ ɔfa mumule aneɛ ɔ nee me adendɛ la . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="62"> Ɛnee menlie menli ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="63"> Duzu a ɛzi a ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="64"> Stéphane ɛzukoa France Mumule Aneɛ ne wɔ efiade . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="65"> Menwunle kɛzi Stéphane ɛlɛtoto ɔ sa nee kɛzi ɔlɛyɛ ɔ nyunlu la , me nye liele kpole wɔ mekɛ mɔɔ ɛnee melɛdwenle mɔɔ ɛhye amuala bahile amaa me anwo la . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="66"> Stéphane nee me bɔle ɔ bo zukoale Baebolo ne . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="67"> Ɔvi zɔhane mekɛ ne yɛɛ membɔle ɔ bo kɛ mefa Baebolo nu nɔhalɛ ngyikyi mɔɔ mezukoa la kɔsɔɔti meabɔ nu a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="68"> Mekɛ mɔɔ mele kakula la , ɛnee me nye die nvoninli ngɛnlɛma mɔɔ wɔ yɛ Baebolo mbuluku ne anu la anwo , ɛnee mefa menli mɔɔ wɔ nvoninli ne anu la metoto nwo na mesuzu debie biala mɔɔ wɔ nu la anwo amaa edwɛkɛ ne aha me adwenle nu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="69"> Ɛnee mezukoa Ebileham , “ abozonli ” ne yɛɛ “ menli pemgbenleamgbe ” ne anwo debie , noko mekɛ mɔɔ bɛhilehilele ɛhye anu wɔ mumule aneɛ nu la yɛɛ mendele ɔ bo kpalɛ a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="70"> ( Mɔlebɛbo 22 : 15 - 18 ; Yekile 7 : 9 ) Ɛnee ɔda ali wienyi kɛ me sa ɛha aneɛ mɔɔ mete la , aneɛ mɔɔ la me ahonle nwo la . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="71"> Mekɛ mɔɔ ɛnee mekɔ debiezukoalɛ a mete mɔɔ bɛka abo la , ɔhanle me ahonle na ɛnee mekulo kɛ mesukoa dɔɔnwo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="72"> Ɔlua Stéphane moalɛ zo , ndelebɛbo mɔɔ melɛ wɔ Baebolo ne anu la yɛle kpole , na wɔ 1992 , menyilale me nwo zo memanle Gyihova Nyamenle na bɛzɔnenle me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="73"> Noko akee , ɔnva nwo kɛ menyia anyuhɔlɛ la , kɛmɔ me nee menli andendɛ wɔ me ngakula nu la ati , ɔmaa mese nyiane yɛɛ menea me nwo boɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="74"> Awieleɛ bɔkɔɔ ne , bɛvale mumulema ekpunli ekyi ne mɔɔ mewɔ nu la bɛbokale asafo bie mɔɔ wɔ Pessac , mɔɔ wɔ Bordeaux ɛleka bie la anwo . <br>

(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="75"> Ɛhye boale kpalɛ , na mengɔle zo menyianle anyuhɔlɛ wɔ sunsum nu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="76"> Ɔwɔ nuhua kɛ ɛnee ɔyɛ se ɔmaa me kɛ me nee menli badendɛ ɛdeɛ , noko me gɔnwo mɔ mɔɔ te edwɛkɛ la nleanle kɛ mebade debie biala abo . <br>

(trg)="77"> Gilles nee Elodie mɔɔ le agyalɛma la bɔle mɔdenle kɛ bɛ nee me badendɛ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>

(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="80"> Me ye Vanessa boa me kpalɛ <br>

(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="81"> Asafo ɛhye anu a menwunle Vanessa mɔɔ anwo yɛ fɛ la . <br>

(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="82"> Atiakunlukɛnlɛma nee pɛlepɛlelilɛ mɔɔ wɔ ɔ nwo la manle me nye liele ɔ nwo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="83"> Yeambu kɛzi mele mumule la kɛ adenzilɛ , emomu , ɔbule ye kɛ ɔbamaa yeanyia anwubielɛ kɛnlɛma . <br>

(trg)="84"> Mengulole ye , na yɛgyale wɔ 2005 anu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
