(trg)="28"> Kasi tikumanya wuli kuti Yehova wakayowoyanga na ŵanthu ŵake mu Chihebere pera yayi ? <br>
<hr>

(trg)="29"> Yehova wakayowoyanga na ŵanthu mu Chihebere pera yayi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> After the Babylonian exile , Aramaic became the everyday language of some of God’s people . <br>
(trg)="30"> Mwachiyelezgero , Ŵaisrayeli ŵati ŵawerako ku uzga ku Babuloni , ŵateŵeti ŵanyake ŵa Chiuta ŵakayowoyanga Chiaramu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Perhaps to indicate what was to come , Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic . ​ — See the footnotes to Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>
(trg)="31"> Pakuti Yehova wakamanya ivyo vikaŵa munthazi , wakaphalira Daniyeli , Yeremiya , na Ezira kuti ŵalembe mazgu ghake mu Chiaramu . — Wonani mazgu gha musi mu buku la Ezira 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Yeremiya 10 : 11 ; na Daniyeli 2 : 4 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> How did God’s Word become available in languages other than Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="32"> Kasi vikenda wuli kuti Mazgu gha Chiuta ghasangike mu Chigiriki ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Alexander the Great later conquered much of the ancient world , and common , or Koine , Greek became an international language . <br>
(trg)="33"> Alexander Mukuru wati wamba kuwusa , ŵanthu ŵanandi ŵakamba kuyowoya Chigiriki chipusu , chakuchemeka Koine . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Many Jews began to speak that language , leading to the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek . <br>
(trg)="35"> Ichi chikapangiska kuti ŵanthu ŵanyake ŵambe kung’anamura Malemba gha Chihebere kuya mu Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> This translation , thought to have been done by 72 translators , became known as the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="37"> Nkhwantha zinyake zikusachizga kuti Baibolo ili , likang’anamurika na ŵanthu 72 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> It was the first translation of the Bible and one of the most important . <br>
(src)="39"> Septuagint means “ Seventy . ” <br>
(trg)="38"> * Pakung’anamura , ŵanyake ŵakang’anamuranga lizgu pa lizgu kweni ŵanyake ŵakang’anamuranga waka fundo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> Translation reportedly began in Egypt in the third century B.C.E . and may have been finished by 150 B.C.E . <br>
(trg)="39"> Ivi vikapangiska kuti Baibolo ili lipulikikwenge mwakupambanapambana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> This translation is still important , as it gives scholars insight into the meaning of certain obscure Hebrew words and passages . <br>
(trg)="40"> Ndipouli , Ŵakhristu na Ŵayuda ŵanandi awo ŵakayowoyanga Chigiriki , ŵakawonanga Baibolo ili kuti ni Mazgu gha Chiuta . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> The work of so many translators resulted in varied translation styles , from literal to rather free . <br>
(trg)="41"> Kasi Yesu wakasambizganga mu chiyowoyero wuli ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Nevertheless , the Septuagint was viewed as God’s Word by Greek - speaking Jews and later by Christians . <br>
(trg)="42"> Yesu , Mwana wakwamba wa Chiuta , wakayowoyanga na kusambizga ŵanthu mu Chihebere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> What language did Jesus likely use to teach his disciples ? <br>
(trg)="43"> Chihebere icho chikayowoyekanga mu nyengo ya Ŵakhristu ŵakwambilira chikaŵa chakusazgikana na Chiaramu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> When God’s firstborn came to earth , he likely spoke and taught in what the Bible calls Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="44"> Ntheura Yesu wakwenera kuti wakayowoyangaso Chiaramu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(trg)="45"> Kweniso Yesu wakamanyanga Chihebere icho chikayowoyekanga mu nyengo ya Mozesi na zintchimi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> However , he also knew the ancient Hebrew of Moses and the prophets , which was read each week in the synagogues . <br>
(trg)="46"> Mipukutu iyo sabata yiliyose ŵakaŵazganga mu sunagoge , yikalembeka mu Chihebere ichi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> In addition , Greek and Latin were spoken in Israel . <br>
(trg)="47"> Mu nyengo ya Yesu , Chigiriki na Chilatini vikayowoyekangaso mu charu cha Israyeli . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages . <br>
(trg)="48"> Kweni Baibolo likuyowoya yayi usange Yesu wakayowoyangaso viyowoyero ivi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>
(trg)="49"> 8 , 9 . <br>
(trg)="50"> Chifukwa wuli Ŵakhristu pakusambizga ŵakayowoyanga Chigiriki , ndipo fundo iyi yikulongorachi vya Yehova ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Jesus ’ early followers knew Hebrew , but after his death , his disciples spoke other languages . <br>
(trg)="51"> Ŵalondezgi ŵa Yesu ŵakayowoyanga Chihebere , kweni Yesu wakati wafwa , ŵakamba kuyowoya viyowoyero vinyake . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>
(trg)="52"> ( Ŵazgani Milimo 6 : 1 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="53"> Apo Chikhristu chikathandazgikanga , kanandi Ŵakhristu pakusambizga ŵakayowoyanga Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="54"> Nakuti mabuku gha Mateyu , Mariko , Luka , na Yohane ghakalembeka mu Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Thus , the language of many disciples was Greek rather than Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="55"> Mabuku agha ghakulongosora ivyo Yesu wakasambizganga na kuchita . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="56"> Ŵasambiri ŵanandi ŵakayowoyanga Chigiriki mu malo mwa Chihebere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(trg)="57"> * Makalata agho mpositole Paulosi wakalemba , na mabuku ghanyake gha mu Baibolo ghakalembeka mu Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> What does this indicate about Jehovah ? <br>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="58"> Awo ŵakalemba mabuku gha Mateyu m’paka Chivumbuzi , kanandi para ŵakukhumba kukora mazgu ghanyake mu Malemba gha Chihebere ŵakagwiliskiranga ntchito Baibolo lakwamba kung’anamurika mu Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> These quotations , which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording , are now part of the inspired Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="59"> Mazgu agha ghali mu Baibolo nangauli ghanyake ghakalembeka ndendende yayi nga umo ghakalembekera mu Malemba gha Chihebere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="60"> Yehova ni Chiuta wambura sankho , ndipo wakugwiliskira ntchito ŵanthu kuti ŵang’anamure Mazgu ghake , Baibolo . — Ŵazgani Milimo 10 : 34 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="61"> Kasi Yehova wakuchita wuli kuti ŵanthu ŵapulike Mazgu ghake ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Our brief review of God’s communication with humans teaches us that Jehovah communicates according to need and circumstances . <br>
(trg)="62"> Ivyo tadumbiskana pa nkhani iyi , vikulongora kuti Yehova wakuyowoya na ŵanthu kuyana na umo vinthu viliri . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>
(trg)="63"> Yehova wakugwiliskira ntchito chiyowoyero chimoza pera yayi kuti ŵanthu ŵapulike Mazgu ghake na khumbo lake . <br>

(src)="65"> ( Read Zechariah 8 : 23 ; Revelation 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
(trg)="64"> ( Ŵazgani Zekariya 8 : 23 ; Chivumbuzi 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Jehovah directed the inspiration of the Bible , but he allowed it to be presented in different styles . <br>
(trg)="65"> Yehova ndiyo wakatuma ŵanthu kuti ŵalembe Baibolo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> Why have language differences not hindered God’s communication with people ? <br>
(trg)="66"> Kasi Yehova wakukwaniska wuli kuyowoya na ŵanthu ŵaviyowoyero vyose ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> Has God’s communication with humans been hindered by the use of different languages and minor variations in translation ? <br>
(src)="69"> No . <br>
(trg)="67"> Yehova wakuyowoya na ŵanthu ŵaviyowoyero vyose , lekani mazgu ghake ghakusangika mu viyowoyero vinandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> For example , we may be aware of only a few of the original - language words that Jesus used . <br>
(trg)="68"> Mu Baibolo muli mazgu ghachoko waka agho ghachali nga umo Yesu wakaghayowoyera . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> However , Jehovah made sure that Jesus ’ message was transmitted in Greek and , in time , in other languages . <br>
(trg)="69"> Kweni Yehova wakawoneseska kuti mazgu gha Yesu ghang’anamurike mu Chigiriki na mu viyowoyero vinyake . <br>

(src)="72"> Later , Bible manuscripts were copied again and again by Jews and Christians , preserving the holy writings . <br>
(trg)="70"> Pamanyuma , Ŵayuda na Ŵakhristu ŵakalutilira kukopera mipukutu ya mazgu gha Chiuta na kuyisunga . <br>
