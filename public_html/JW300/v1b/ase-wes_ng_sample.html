(trg)="39"> Instead , na the kind one wey Paul talk about for Bible . <br>
<hr>

(trg)="40"> E say : “ Now wuna don know God , or make I say , God don know wuna . <br>

<hr>
(src)="38"> When he pleaded with Jehovah to allow him to come to know His ways more fully , Jehovah replied : “ I will also do this thing that you request , because you have found favor in my eyes and I know you by name . ” <br>
(trg)="51"> One time , e beg Jehovah say e want know who Jehovah really be . <br>
(trg)="52"> Then God answer Moses say : “ I go still do this thing wey you want , because I like you and I know the kind person wey you really be . ” <br>

(trg)="55"> But wetin we go do so that Jehovah go take us as e friend ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> We do that when we come to love him and dedicate our life to him . ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 8 : 3 . <br>

<hr>
(src)="44"> However , we need to maintain our treasured relationship with our heavenly Father . <br>
(trg)="59"> But , we need to keep our friendship with Jehovah tight . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Like the Galatian Christians to whom Paul wrote , we too need to avoid slaving for “ the weak and beggarly elementary things ” of this world , including seeking its acclaim . <br>
(trg)="60"> Just as Paul advice the Christians for Galatia , make we self no slave for “ the weak things wey they no mean anything ” for this world . <br>
(trg)="61"> Part of this things na when person de try make e dey popular for this world . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Those first - century Christians had progressed to the point of being known by God . <br>
(trg)="62"> ( Gal . <br>
(trg)="63"> 4 : 9 ) The Christians for Galatia don already know God , and God know them . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> However , Paul said that the very same brothers were “ turning back again ” to empty things . <br>
(trg)="64"> But Paul talk say the same people de “ go back again ” to useless things . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Paul was , in effect , saying : “ After you have come so far , why would you return to the foolish , valueless things you left behind ? ” <br>
(trg)="65"> E just be as if Paul de talk say : “ After wuna don do all this many things so that wuna fit serve God , why wuna go back to the foolish and useless things wey wuna don troway ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> Could we find ourselves in a similar position today ? <br>
(trg)="66"> This kind thing fit happen to us today ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Yes , we could . <br>
(trg)="67"> Yes , e fit happen . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> When we first came to know Jehovah , we , like Paul , may have given up prominence in Satan’s world . <br>
(trg)="68"> Maybe we leave some things wey they for make us popular for the world because we want serve God . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> ( Read Philippians 3 : 7 , 8 . ) <br>
(trg)="70"> ( Read Philippians 3 : 7 , 8 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Perhaps we gave up opportunities to receive higher education , or we may have turned down promotions or the possibility for making more money in the business world . <br>
(trg)="72"> E fit still be say we for make plenty money for business , but we no do like that . <br>
(trg)="73"> Maybe we sabi music or sport , and we for dey popular and get money if we do this things . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> Our musical talents or athletic abilities could have potentially led us to fame and wealth , but we turned our backs on all of that . <br>
(trg)="74"> But , we troway all this things . <br>
(trg)="75"> ( Heb . <br>
(trg)="76"> 11 : 24 - 27 ) Na better thing we do . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> How unwise it would be for us now to view such good decisions as ‘ missed opportunities ’ ! <br>
(trg)="77"> But make we no begin think say our life for better if to say we follow the things wey we don leave ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> Such thinking might lead us to seek out what we already determined were among “ the weak and beggarly ” elements of this world . <br>
(trg)="78"> If we do like that , e fit make us go back to the useless things wey we don troway before . <br>
<hr>

<hr>
(src)="58"> What will strengthen our resolve to seek Jehovah’s recognition ? <br>
(trg)="80"> Wetin go help us do everything wey we fit do to make sure say Jehovah value us ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> How can we strengthen our resolve to seek Jehovah’s recognition and not that of the world ? <br>
(trg)="81"> Na God we want make e value us , no be the world . <br>
(trg)="82"> So , wetin go help us do everything wey we fit do to make sure say God value us ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> To do so , we need to remember two important facts . <br>
(trg)="83"> Na two important things we need to get for mind , and this things go help us . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> First , Jehovah always gives recognition to those who serve him faithfully . <br>
(trg)="84"> The first one be say , Jehovah de bless people wey them de always follow e way . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> ( Read Hebrews 6 : 10 ; 11 : 6 ) He deeply appreciates every one of his servants , and he views it as “ unrighteous ” to ignore those who are faithful to him . <br>
(trg)="85"> ( Read Hebrews 6 : 10 ; 11 : 6 ) God really value all e servant , and e see - am as “ bad ” thing if e no bless people wey them de follow e way . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Jehovah always “ knows those who belong to him . ” <br>
(trg)="86"> Jehovah always “ know who be e own . ” <br>
(trg)="87"> ( 2 Tim . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He is “ aware of the way of the righteous ” and knows how to rescue them out of trial . ​ — Ps . <br>
(trg)="88"> 2 : 19 ) E “ know wetin righteous person de do , ” and e know how to save them from problem . ​ — Ps . <br>

(trg)="89"> 1 : 6 ; 2 Pet . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> 2 : 9 . <br>
(trg)="90"> 2 : 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> Give examples of how Jehovah has shown his approval of his people . <br>
(trg)="91"> Give examples of how Jehovah don show say e really value e people . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> At times , Jehovah has shown his approval of his people in outstanding ways . <br>
(trg)="92"> Sometimes , Jehovah use special way show e people say e value them . <br>
(trg)="93"> ( 2 Chron . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> Take , for example , the way Jehovah saved his people at the Red Sea when they were being pursued by Pharaoh’s mighty army . <br>
(trg)="94"> 20 : 20 , 29 ) For example , think about how God save e people for Red Sea when the strong army of Pharaoh want catch them . <br>
(trg)="95"> ( Ex . <br>
(trg)="96"> 14 : 21 - 30 ; Ps . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> This event was so spectacular that people in that part of the world were still speaking about it 40 years later . <br>
(trg)="97"> 106 : 9 - 11 ) The way Jehovah save e people dey wonderful . <br>
(trg)="98"> Even after 40 years , other people for that part of the world still de talk about - am . <br>
(trg)="99"> ( Josh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> How encouraging it is for us to remember such displays of Jehovah’s love and power as we face the long - foretold attack by Gog of Magog ! <br>
(trg)="100"> 2 : 9 - 11 ) Small time , Gog of Magog wey Bible talk about go attack us . <br>
(trg)="101"> But when we remember how God show e love and power to save e people , e de make us get strong heart . <br>
(trg)="102"> ( Ezek . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> At that time , we will be especially grateful that we sought the recognition of our God and not that of the world . <br>
(trg)="103"> 38 : 8 - 12 ) When that time reach , we go happy because we don do everything to make sure say God value us , instead of this world . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> What aspect of Jehovah’s recognition must we keep in mind ? <br>
(trg)="104"> Which other thing we need to get for mind about how Jehovah de show say e value us ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> We also need to keep in mind a second important fact : Jehovah may give us recognition in ways we may never expect . <br>
(trg)="105"> The second thing wey we need to get for mind be say : The way Jehovah go show say e value us fit surprise us . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> Those who do good deeds purely to be seen by men are told that they will have no reward at all from Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="106"> If people de do good things just because they want make other people see them , Jehovah no go bless them . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Why ? <br>
(trg)="107"> Why ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> Their reward has already been paid in full when they receive praise from others . <br>
(trg)="108"> Na because the praise wey people de give them , na their complete payment . <br>
