(src)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
(trg)="1"> YOWIIRANEYA YA MUTTHU <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="3"> Ntoko sihimmwale aya ni Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="4"> Waari mwaakha wa 1975 , kaarina iyaakha piili , vaavo amaama yaapacenrya aya ohoverya wira miyo kaahikhalana etthu yahaalonke . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="5"> Amaama yaakikunxe mmatatani , nto mpatthani aya muthiyana aahimoroxela vathi etthu yootepa olemela , khokumiherya onyakula wuulupale . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="6"> Nuumala okiweha , amaama yahoona wira onyakula waakhumelenle khiwaakitutunxe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="7"> Nuumala iyaakha tthaaru , nlelo nkaawerya olavula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="8"> Muhoolo mwaya , emusi aka yahiiwa ihapari soohiloka , meediko aahimyale wira miyo kookhalana oretta wa ohiiwa okhala wene ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="9"> Nlelo kiryeene mwaana mukhaani , anamuyari aka yaahimwalana , nto Amaama yahaana okihuwa miyo vamosa ni annaka owunnuwela , axinnaka anli ni murokoraka mmosa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="10"> Okathi ole oFrança , anamwane yaarina oretta wa ohiiwa , oxikola khiyaasomihiwa ntoko sinisomihiwa aya mahiku ala , ohiya - vo , inamuna sarumeeliwa ikwaha sikina saanikumiherya ohaawa wuulupale . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="11"> Hata vaari siiso , okhuma onamwane aka kaahikhalana eparakha waavikana akina yaarina oretta wa ohiiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="12"> Mukihiye kitthokiherye . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="13"> Okathi ole , maprusoore manceene yaakupali wira atthu ahiniiwa yahaana oxuttihiwa erumeeliwa enamuna ya olavula , nto ole ohiniiwa khiyaweha weeteteya wa iyano sa mutthu onilavula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="14"> Tthiri oFrança opuro waakhala aka , oxikola wamukhoottihiwa olavula ni matata wa atthu ahiniiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="15"> Okathi woosoma , anamwane akina yaarina oretta wa ohiiwa , matata aya yamutthukiwa ottuli wira ahithoonyaseke . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="16"> Iyaakha vakhaani sa wanipacerya wa okumi aka , kaaniviriha iwoora sinci khuta esumana kiixuttihiwaka moota woosuwela ele iyano saahimya aya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="17"> Atthu yaavara iyano saka wala muru khiyakikhanyererya ikwaha sinceene wira kilavuleke masu yahaawerya aka wiiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="18"> Nkaawerya olavula ni anamwane akina . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="19"> Tthiri nkireere ohaawa okathi ole . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="20"> Nto , kirineene iyaakha 6 , kaahiroihiwa exikola yaasomiha anamwane ahiniiwa okhala wene . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="21"> Owo waari okathi waapacenrye aka okumanana anamwane yahiiwa ntoko miyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="22"> Opuro ole waanikhoottihiwa - tho olavula ni matata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="23"> Akhala wira naamulavula ni matata naanisuwela wira matata ahu yammaniwa aahiiso ikharari sahu wala maihi saarowa okokhiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="24"> Masi , okathi wahooniwa ahu , hiyo naanilavula ni matata nirumeelaka ithoonyeryo saapakale ahu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="25"> Nto khupacerya wiiwanana ni anamwane akina . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="26"> Waari opacerya waka ohakalala wa iyaakha thaaru . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="27"> Okathi waarina aka iyaakha 10 , kaaroihiwe exikola primaaria ya anamwane aniiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="28"> Eyo yaahikikhulumula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="29"> Koona wira anamwane akina otheene yahiiwa , yaahikhwa nto miyo khuhala ekhaka mulaponi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="30"> Mwaha woophavela wiiwelela miruku saavahiwa aya ni doctore , yoowo oona wira miyo kaamuliyala itthu saaxuttihiwa aka ni exikola ele ya olavula ni iyano , amaama khiyaaxuttale elavulelo ya matata , ohiya - vo , kaanikhoottiheriwa othweela ni anamwane yaarina muxankiho wa ohiiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="31"> Mpakha - va kinnuupuwela nihiku naarowale ahu okumana ni mulipa - oosoma oretta wa ohiiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="32"> Yoowo aarina eliivuru ya nttaava ninlavuliwa ni matata vameesa vawe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> Nuumala woona efootu vakaapani , khahithoonya kihimya so : “ Kimphavela eliivuru eyo ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="34"> Nto , nananoru doctore aahivitha eliivuru ele . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="35"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="37"> Amaama yaanimananiha oniixuttiha weettela sooruma sa eKristau . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="38"> Naanirowa hoothe omuthukumanoni muloko wa Mérignac wa Anamona a Yehova , waattamela oBordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="39"> Mwaha wookhala mwaana kiixutta itthu vakhaani paahi omuthukumanoni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="40"> Masi , anna a mmulokoni , yaaniranttelana okilaathi opuro waarya aka , nto khiyalepa itthu saahimmwa wira miyo kisomeke . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="41"> Okiphenta ni okoonela waya othunku waahikivara murima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="42"> Owaani amaama yaanikiixuttiha Biibiliya , masi nkinaiwaxexe saana etthu ene yaaxuttihiwa aka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> Kaari nto profeta Daniyeli , nuumala nlaikha omuhimyeerya eprofesia , owo aahimyale so : “ Miyo kahìwa molumo awo , masi nkasuwenle sahimyaya ” . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="44"> ( Daniyeli 12 : 8 ) Moovirikana ni Daniyeli , miyo “ kanooona masi nkaasuwela saahimmwa ” . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="45"> Hata vaari siiso , vakhani - vakhani ikeekhai suulupale saahikela vamurimani vaka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="46"> Kaanivarexexa itthu vakhaani saiwexexa aka saana ni kaanimananiha weettela . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="47"> Itthu sikina kaniixutta mwaha wooweha mweettelo wa atthu akina . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="48"> Mwa ntakiheryo , Biibiliya onnixuttiha okhala oopixa murima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="49"> ( Yakobo 5 : 7 , 8 ) Miyo nkaasuwela saana ele opixa murima onitaphulela aya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="50"> Masi , oweha mweettelo wa anna akina , waanikiiriha osuwela saana yootaphulela aya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="51"> Tthiri muloko wa eKristau khoreere okikhaliherya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="52"> OKHUMUWA WUULUPALE NI YOOTUTUXERYA YOOTEPEXA OREERA <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="53"> Nihiku nimosa , eriyari ya iyaakha 13 mpakha 18 , kahaaweha amiravo muruuwa alavulaka nttaava ninlavuliwa ni matata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="54"> Kipacerya weetta ni awosa wiiphiini , nto khupacerya wiixutta Nttaava na Matata na oFrança . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="55"> Kaanivikaniha orowa mithukumano sa eKristau , nto omulokoni mmiravo mmosa Namoona iitthaniwa Stefane aahikoonela othunku . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="56"> Aanipaka itthu sinci ophavelaka wiiwanana ni miyo , nto eyo yaahikiiriha omoonaka okhala mutthu aakithokorerya saana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="57"> Masi , yaamwiiraneya etthu yaarowa okikhulumula . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="58"> Mwaha woweettela sooruma sa eKristau , Stefane aahikhootta wiirela mpantta ekhotto , nto khuroihiwa mukhatteya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="59"> Murima waahitepa okiriipa ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="60"> Okathi Stefane aaryaawe mukhatteya , kaahitepa otteettheya , mpakha ohiya orowa omuthukumanoni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="61"> Nuumala myeeri 11 , aahikumihiwa mukhatteya nto khutthikela owaani . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="62"> Nkahaya muupuwele moota waahakalanle aka , vaavo Stefane aalavula awe ni miyo orumeelaka Nttaava na Matata na oFrança . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="63"> Nkaakupali etthu yoona aka ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="64"> Etthu xeeni yiiranen’ye ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="65"> Mukhatteya , Stafane aahiixutta Nttaava na Matata na oFrança . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="66"> Nto vaavo aarumeela awe matata ni owiitho wawe wira olavule ni miyo , murima aka waanitthapa mwaha woowiiwa saana yootaphulela ya khuta etthu yaahimya awe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="68"> Stefane aahipacerya omusoma Biibiliya ni miyo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="69"> Nto ti vaapacenrya aka olupanya ipantte kamosa - kamosa sa ikeekhai sa Biibiliya saaxuttale aka khalai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="70"> Kiryeene mwaana , vaanikisivela oweha ifootu sooreera sa iliivuru sahu sa Biibiliya , kaanivarerya saana khuta etthu vafootuni - vo , ni otokosa khuta etthu wira kihiliyale . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="71"> Nnaamwi kaasuwela sa Abrahamu ni osuulu awe , vamosa ni ‘ muttitthi muulupale ’ , itthu iyo kaahiiwexexe saana , paahi nuumala woona sitthokiheriwaka ni nttaava ninlavuliwa ni matata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="72"> ( Maphattuwelo 22 : 15 - 18 ; Wisupulula 7 : 9 ) Eyo yahikiiriha woona wira tthiri koophwanya nttaava naka , nttaava ninkivara murima . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="73"> Vano vaniwerya aka osuwelexa saana itthu sinihimmwa mmuthukumanoni , murima aka woohakalala ni ophavela waka wiixutta ekeekhai ohinnuwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="74"> Kikhaliheriwaka ni Stefane , wiiwexexa waka itthu sa Biibiliya waanirowa vahoolo , nto 1992 , kaahivahererya okumi aka wa Yehova Muluku , nto khubatiziwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="75"> Nnaamwi kaapanke mirukunuxo sinceene , mwaha wa itthu saakiiranenle kiryeene anamwane , nlelo kanuuliwa muru , ni vaanivila waatthokiherya saana atthu akina moonelo aka . <br>
(trg)="76"> OWANANA MUXANKIHO WA WUULIWA MURU <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="77"> Nuuvira okathi , egrupu ele ekhaani yaarya aka , ya atthu ahiniiwa yaahitakaahiwa ni muloko wa Pessac , oxerexere wa ebairo ya Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="78"> Eyo yaahikikhaliherya vanci , nto kaahivikaniha orowa vahoolo omunepani . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="79"> Hata kaawanana muxankiho aka wa wuuliwa muru , apatthani aka aniiwa yaanikikhaliherya ephavelaka wira ehikhale etthu ehiniiwa aka saana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="80"> Emusi emosa ; Gilles ni Elodie , yahiimananiha vanci wira ekitthokiheryeke itthu saana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="81"> Ikwaha sikina yaanikilattula orowa olya hoothe wala onwurya café hothe nuumala mithukumano , nto khukhala apatthani aka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="82"> Tthiri ti voohakalaliha okhala eriyari ya atthu anitthara iphiro soophenta sa Muluku ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="83"> Muloko wa Pessac , kaahimoona murokora oreera oniitthaniwa Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="84"> Oreera wawe murima ni ophavela wawe weettela exariya , wahikiiriha osiveliwa ni yena . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="85"> Vanessa khoona muxankiho aka okhala ntoko etthu enikhoottiherya wiiwanana , masi onoona okhala eparakha ya wiixutta olavula ni atthu ahiniiwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
(trg)="86"> Tivonto , Vanessa aahikuxa murima aka , nto khuthelana mwaakha wa 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="87"> Nnaamwi kirine ene muxankiho wa wuuliwa muru , Vanessa onnikikhaliherya owanana muxankiho owo , nto khiyawerya otthokiherya saana moonelo aka . <br>

<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>

(trg)="91"> Mahiku ala efiliyaali ennivara muteko munceene wira akumiheriwe aDVD a iliivuru sa Nttaava na Matata na oFrança . <br>

(src)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>
(src)="90"> Giving a Bible talk in French Sign Language <br>
(trg)="92"> Nto okhala wira muteko waanincerereya , anamataphulela yahaana wuncereriwa - tho . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
(trg)="93"> Miyo ni Vanessa , noona wira miyo orowa orumeela ofiliyaali yaari eparakha yuulupale ni yoovaha enikhuma wa Yehova Muluku , masi , kihaana ohimya wira nanoovelela . <br>

<hr>
(src)="94"> Would Vanessa find work in the region ? <br>
(trg)="96"> Niireke Vanessa amphwanya muteko muttetthe owo ? <br>

(src)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
(trg)="97"> Masi wa khuta muxankiho Yehova aahinooniherya etthu yoopaka . <br>

(src)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>
