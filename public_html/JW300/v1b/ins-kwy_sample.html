(src)="1"> LIFE STORY <br>
(trg)="1"> LUSANSU <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> Lwa Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="3"> Muna mvu a 1975 vava yakala ye kimbuta kia mvu 2 , o ngudi ame wabakula vo diambu yakala diau . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="4"> Ekolo yakala muna nkata a ngw’ame , nkundi andi wabwisa lekwa kia zitu va ntoto yo vanga mazu mayingi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="5"> Kansi , kiasusumuka nkutu ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="6"> Yamuna kimbuta kia mvu tatu , kialendanga vova ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="7"> I bosi , mase mame bazayiswa diambu diankenda , o dotolo wabavovesa vo omono i fwa matu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="8"> O longo lwa mase mame lwafwa vava yakala nsedia . <br>
(trg)="9"> O ngw’ame watusansa yandi mosi kaka ye mpangi zame tatu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="10"> Muna lumbu yayina o wana afwa matu ku França ke balongwanga ko nze una belongelwanga o unu , e ndekwa za longela mpe ke zakala zambote ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="11"> Kana una vo i wau , tuka kileke kiame yakala ye lau dina afwa matu akaka ke bakala diau ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="12"> Yambula yasasila . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(trg)="13"> Vava yakala ye mvu tanu <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="14"> Tuka kolo , alongi bakwikilanga vo wana afwa matu bafwete longoka o vova muna sianga sungididi muna befo ya wantu ekolo bevovanga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="15"> Ku França oku yasansukila , basimanga wantu mu longa nding’a sinsu kuna sikola . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="16"> Wana akaka nkutu afwa matu bakangwanga o moko kuna sikola . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="17"> Muna kileke kiame , yavaulanga ola zayingi konso lumingu mu sadiswa kwa nlongi walonganga wantu mu zaya o vova . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="18"> Wansimbanga vana befo yovo vana ntu yo kunkomekena yavutukilanga vova mambu yalembi wanga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="19"> Kialendanga mokena ye aleke akaka ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="20"> E mvu miamina miakala miampasi kwa mono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="21"> Vava yalungisa mvu sambanu , yafilwa kuna internato , sikola ya wana afwa matu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="22"> E wau i nkumbu antete yawanana yo wan’akaka afwa matu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="23"> Kuna internato yayina mpe , nding’a sinsu yasimwanga longwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="24"> Vava twatezanga vanga e sinsu muna kalasi , twawandwanga yovo tuntwa e nsuki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="25"> Kansi , twasokanga yo vanga e sinsu ya ndinga yayi kuna kinsweki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="26"> Kuna kwalanda , yayantika mokena yo wana akaka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="27"> Muna kuma kiaki , yayantika mona kiese . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="28"> Vava yalungisa mvu kumi , yasobwa muna sikola yakala yo wana akaka bena vo ke afwa matu ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="29"> Yakendalala kikilu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="30"> Yamona nze wana awonso afwa matu , bafwa ye mono kaka yasala mu nza yawonso . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="31"> Muna lemvokela luludiku lwa madotolo ana bayindulanga vo yadi vidisa elau dialongoka vova , esi nzo ame ke balongoka nding’a sinsu ko yo kunsima mu vanga kikundi yo wana afwa matu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="32"> Isungamenanga nkingula twavanga kwa dotolo dimosi ona wakala ye nkanda a nding’a sinsu vana meza mandi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="33"> Vava yamona fwaniswa yakala muna fukwa kia nkanda , yasonga nlembo yo vova vo : “ Nkanda wau nzolele ! ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> The doctor quickly hid the book . <br>
(trg)="34"> Muna nzaki zawonso dotolo wasweka nkanda wauna . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> * <br>
(trg)="35"> * <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="36"> Ngw’eto wayantika kutulonga e nkanikinu mia Nkand’a Nzambi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="37"> Watunatanga kuna Eseka dia Kintinu dia Mbangi za Yave kuna Mérignac diakala lukufi ye mbanza Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="38"> Wau vo mwan’akete yakala , kiabakulanga mambu mayingi ko muna tukutakanu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="39"> Ndonga muna awana bavwandanga yame , bansonekenanga mana malongwanga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="40"> O zola kwau yo mfunu bamvwanga diasimba o ntim’ame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="41"> Kuna nzo , ngw’ame wandonganga Nkand’a Nzambi , kansi kiabakulanga mana kandonganga ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="42"> Yamona nze una kamona Daniele wa ngunza vava katambula ungunza kwa mbasi yo vova vo : “ Omono ngwidi ke mu bakula ko . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="43"> ( Daniele 12 : 8 ) Kwa mono “ yamona , kansi kiabakula ko . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="44"> I bosi , malembe malembe yayantika bakula ludi kia Nkand’a Nzambi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="45"> Mana yabakulanga yakotesanga mo mu ntima yo sadila mo muna zingu kiame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="46"> Yalongoka mpe mayingi muna tanginina mavangu ma wantu akaka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="47"> Muna bong’e nona , o Nkand’a Nzambi ukutulonganga vo twasonganga luzindalalu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="48"> Kansi , kiabakulanga ko nki i luzindalalu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="49"> Kansi , ekolo yamonanga e kadilu kia mpangi zame kuna nkutakani , yabakula nsas’a luzindalalu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="50"> Dialudi , nsambu zayingi itambulanga muna nkutakani ya Akristu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="51"> Stéphane wansadisa mu bakula Nkand’a Nzambi <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="52"> Vava yakituka s’etoko , lumbu kimosi yamona buka kia aleke bamokenanga mu nding’a sinsu muna nzila . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="53"> Kuna kinsweki , yavanga yau kikundi yo yantika longoka ndinga sinsu ya França ( FSL ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="54"> Yakwamanana kwenda kuna tukutakanu twa Kikristu yo wanana yo Stéphane wa toko dimosi dia Mbangi a Yave ona wamvwanga o mfunu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="55"> Stéphane , wasia ngolo muna mokenanga yame yo kituka se nkundi ame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="56"> Kansi , ke kolo ko vabwa diambu diankendeleka kikilu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="57"> Stéphane wakangwa yo siwa muna pelezo mu kuma kia lembi kuyikotesa mu mambu ma tuyalu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="58"> Ekolo Stéphane kakala muna pelezo , yakendalala yo yambula kwenda kuna tukutakanu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="59"> Vioka ngonde 11 , Stéphane wavaikiswa muna pelezo yo vutuka ku nzo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="60"> Yayangalala kikilu vava Stéphane kamokenanga yame muna ndinga sinsu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="61"> Kia kwikilanga ko mana yamonanga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="62"> Muna pelezo , Stéphane walongoka nding’a sinsu ya França ( FSL ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="63"> Vava yamona e mpila Stéphane kanikuninanga nlembo muna vanga sinsu , e kiese kiame kiawokela yo bakula mawonso mabwa muna zingu kia Stéphane . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="64"> Stéphane , wayantika longoka yame o Nkand’a Nzambi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="65"> Yayantika bakula mawonso yalongokanga mu Nkand’a Nzambi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="66"> Ekolo yakala nleke , yazolanga tala fwaniswa muna nkanda mieto misasilanga Nkand’a Nzambi yo toma yo fimpa kimana tusansu twatu twakota muna ntim’ame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="67"> Kana una vo yazaya ludi mu kuma kia Abarayama , “ mbongo ” andi ye “ ndong’ayingi , ” kansi yabakula nsas’a mambu mama vava yayantika longokela muna ndinga sinsu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="68"> ( Etuku 22 : 15 - 18 ; Lusengomono 7 : 9 ) Owau yasolola e nding’ame ya kingutukila . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="69"> Yayantika bakula mana malongwanga muna tukutakanu , e ludi kiayantika kota mu ntima , e nsatu zame za mambu ma mwanda zawokela . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="70"> Muna lusadisu lwa Stéphane , umbakuzi wame mu kuma kia ludi wawokela , muna mvu a 1992 yayekola zingu kiame kwa Yave wa Nzambi yo vubwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="71"> Kana una vo yanungunuka muna mwanda , nsoni yamonanga muna mokena yo wantu wau vo muna kileke kiamokenanga yo wantu ko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="72"> Ke kolo ko , e buka kiakete kia afwa matu yakala , kiayikakeswa ye nkutakani ya Pessac kuna mbanza Bordeaux . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="73"> Ediadi diansadisa mu kwamanana nungunuka muna mwanda . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="74"> Ekolo yanwananga ye nsoni muna mokena ye wantu , akundi ame ana ke bafwa matu ko bavanganga mawonso kimana yabakula mana bavovanga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="75"> Mpangi Gilles yo Elodie wa nkaz’andi , bavanganga ngolo zayingi muna mokena yame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="76"> Nkumbu miayingi kuna mfoko a tukutakanu , bambokelanga muna dia yau yovo nua kafe , ediadi diasiamisa kikundi kieto . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(trg)="77"> Ekwe kiese kiakala entwadi ye awana bezingilanga ngwizani ye nkanikinu mia Nzambi ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="78"> Vanessa wa nkaz’ame otoma kunsadisanga <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="79"> Muna nkutakani yayina mu yawanana yo Vanessa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(trg)="80"> E fu yandi yambote yamfila muna kunzola . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="81"> Oyandi , kabadikilanga kimbevo kiame ko nze nkaku , kansi nze lau diazaya mokena yo muntu wafwa matu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> She won my heart , and we were married in 2005 . <br>
(trg)="82"> Twazolana yo kazala muna mvu a 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="83"> Kana una vo diampasi diakala mu mokena , Vanessa wansadisa mu sunda e nsoni yo toma mokena yo wantu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> I truly appreciate her support as I care for my responsibilities . <br>
(trg)="84"> Iyangalelanga muna lusadisu kekumpananga ekolo ilunga - lunganga e kiyekwa kiame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
(trg)="85"> Muna mvu twakazala , evula dia Mbangi za Yave kuna França ku mbanza Louviers , diambokela ngienda longoka salu kia sekola mu ngonde mosi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> In recent years the branch has been working very hard to produce several publications in FSL on DVD . <br>
(trg)="86"> Yamu unu , ampangi kuna vula besalanga kwayingi muna sekola nkanda mieto muna nding’a sinsu ya França muna DVD . <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> But with more work ahead , the translation team needed reinforcing . <br>
(trg)="87"> Wau vo e salu mu nungunuka kina , mpangi zayingi bavwilu o mfunu mu sala salu kiaki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="90"> Giving a Bible talk in French Sign Language <br>
(trg)="88"> Vava yafilanga elongi dia Nkand’a Nzambi muna nding’a sinsu ya França <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Both Vanessa and I felt that for me to serve at the branch was an immense privilege and a gift from Jehovah God , but I have to admit that we were apprehensive . <br>
(trg)="89"> Kanele vo mono yo Vanessa twabadikilanga dio vo lau diampwena o sadila kuna vula ye lukau lwa Yave wa Nzambi , kansi twatokananga kikilu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> What would happen to our sign - language group ? <br>

(src)="93"> What would we do with our house ? <br>
(trg)="91"> Adieyi twadi vanga mu kuma kia nzo eto ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> Would Vanessa find work in the region ? <br>
(trg)="92"> Nga Vanessa wadi solola e salu muna mbanza yayina ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> In a wonderful way , Jehovah provided a solution to each problem . <br>
(trg)="93"> Yave wasingika mambu mama mawonso muna mpil’esivi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> I really felt Jehovah’s love for us and for deaf people . <br>
(trg)="94"> Dialudi , yamona vo Yave otoma kutuzolanga kumosi yo nkangu andi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="97"> Having been involved in translation work , I can better understand all that is done to provide spiritual help for the deaf . <br>
(trg)="95"> Wau vo isalanga salu kia nsekola , ibakulanga mawonso mevangwanga muna vana lusadisu lwa mwanda kwa afwa matu . <br>

(src)="98"> And what a pleasure to see many fellow workers try to communicate with me ! <br>
(trg)="96"> Kiese kiayingi imonanga wau vo akundi ame a salu besianga ngolo mu mokena yame . <br>
<hr>
(src)="99"> The few signs that they learn and try to use touch my heart . <br>
