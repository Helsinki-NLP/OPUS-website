(src)="1"> “ I Set the Pattern for You ” <br>
(trg)="1"> ‘ Kua Fakatoka e Au e Fakafifitaki ma Mutolu ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> “ You ought to be teachers in view of the time . ” ​ — HEBREWS 5 : 12 . <br>
(trg)="2"> “ Ane mai eke a mutolu mo tau akoako po kua lata ai ha kua leva . ” — HEPERU 5 : 12 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Why might the words of Hebrews 5 : 12 naturally cause a Christian to feel some measure of concern ? <br>
(trg)="3"> Ko e ha e tau kupu he Heperu 5 : 12 ne kua fakalagalaga pauaki e Kerisiano ke logona hifo taha fuafuaaga he kapaletu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> AS YOU read the inspired words of our theme text , do you feel a measure of concern about yourself ? <br>
(trg)="4"> HE TOTOU e koe e tau kupu omoi he agaga , he mataulu tala ha tautolu , logona nakai e koe taha fuafuaaga he kapaletu hagaao ki a koe ni ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> If so , you are not alone . <br>
(trg)="5"> Ka pihia , kua nakai tokotaha a koe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> As followers of Christ , we know that we must be teachers . <br>
(trg)="6"> Ko e tau tutaki he Keriso , na iloa e tautolu kua lata ia tautolu ke eke mo tau faiaoga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> We know that the times in which we live make it urgent that we teach as well as we can . <br>
(trg)="7"> ( Mataio 28 : 19 , 20 ) Iloa foki e tautolu ko e tau magaaho ne nonofo ai a tautolu ati mafiti ai ke mua atu e mitaki he ha tautolu a fakaakoaga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> And we know that our teaching can even make a life - or - death difference to those whom we teach ! <br>
(trg)="8"> Mo e iloa e tautolu kua maeke he fakaakoaga ha tautolu ke taute e kehe ke he moui po ke mate ha lautolu ne fakaako e tautolu ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Naturally , then , we may ask ourselves : ‘ Am I really the teacher I ought to be ? <br>
(trg)="9"> ( 1 Timoteo 4 : 16 ) Kua lata ni mogoia , ke huhu hifo ki a tautolu : ‘ Kua eke moli kia au mo faiaoga ne kua lata ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> How can I improve ? ’ <br>
(trg)="10"> Maeke fefe ia au ke holo ki mua ? ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> 2 , 3 . ( a ) How did one teacher explain the foundation of good teaching ? <br>
(trg)="11"> 2 , 3 . ( a ) Fakamaama fefe he taha faiaoga e fakaveaga he fakaakoaga mitaki ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> ( b ) Jesus set what pattern for us as to teaching ? <br>
(trg)="12"> ( e ) Ko e heigoa e fakafifitaki ne fakatoka e Iesu ma tautolu hagaao ke he fakaakoaga ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Such concerns need not discourage us . <br>
(trg)="13"> Ko e tau kapaletu pihia kua nakai lata ke fakalolelole aki a tautolu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> If we think of teaching solely in terms of some studied techniques , we might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of making improvements . <br>
(trg)="14"> Kaeke manatu a tautolu ko e fakaakoaga ko e mena kua lata ke makaka lahi ki ai , liga to lofia a tautolu he manatu kua nakai fakaai ke maeke ke holo ki mua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> The foundation of good teaching , though , is not technique but something far more important . <br>
(trg)="15"> Ko e fakaveaga he fakaakoaga mitaki , mogoia , nakai ko e makaka lahi ka ko e taha mena ne mua atu e aoga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Note what one experienced teacher wrote in a book on the subject : “ Good teaching is not a matter of specific techniques or styles , plans or actions . . . . <br>
(trg)="16"> Mailoga la e mena ne tohia he taha faiaoga lotomatala he tohi hagaao ke he matakupu ia : “ Ko e fakaakoaga mitaki kua nakai ko e taha puhala mahifi po ke taha puhala pauaki , tau fakatokatokaaga po ke tau gahuahuaaga . . . . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Teaching is primarily a matter of love . ” <br>
(trg)="17"> Ko e fakaakoaga ko e matapatu puhala he fakaalofa . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> Of course , his perspective was that of a secular teacher . <br>
(trg)="18"> Moli , ko e manatu hana ko e manatu he faiaoga he lalolagi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Still , his point may be even more applicable to the teaching we do as Christians . <br>
(trg)="19"> Pete ia , kua liga hagaao lahi e manatu hana ke he fakaakoaga ne taute e tautolu ko e tau Kerisiano . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> How so ? <br>
(trg)="20"> He puhala fe ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Our Exemplar of a teacher is none other than Jesus Christ , who told his followers : “ I set the pattern for you . ” <br>
(trg)="21"> Ko e ha tautolu a Fifitakiaga ko e faiaoga , kua nakai fai foki ka ko Iesu Keriso hokoia , ne tala age ke he tau tutaki hana : ‘ Kua fakatoka e au e fakafifitaki ma mutolu . ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> He was referring to his example in showing humility , but the pattern Jesus set for us certainly includes his principal work as a man on earth ​ — that of teaching people the good news of God’s Kingdom . <br>
(trg)="22"> ( Ioane 13 : 15 ) Kua hagaao atu a ia ke he fifitakiaga hana ne fakakite e loto fakatokolalo , ka ko e fakafifitaki ne fakatoka e Iesu ma tautolu nukua putoia moli ki ai e gahua aoga lahi hana he eke mo tagata he lalolagi — ke fakaako ke he tau tagata e tala mitaki he Kautu he Atua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Now , if you had to choose a single word to characterize Jesus ’ ministry , you would likely select the word “ love , ” would you not ? <br>
(trg)="23"> ( Luka 4 : 43 ) Mogonei , kaeke fifili e koe taha kupu ke fakamaama aki e fekafekauaga ha Iesu , nakai kia to fifili e koe e kupu “ fakaalofa ” ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> Jesus ’ love for his heavenly Father , Jehovah , was paramount . <br>
(trg)="24"> ( Kolose 1 : 15 ; 1 Ioane 4 : 8 ) Ko e fakaalofa ha Iesu ma e hana Matua he lagi , ko Iehova , kua tokoluga ue atu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> As a teacher , though , Jesus manifested love in two additional ways . <br>
(trg)="25"> ( Ioane 14 : 31 ) Ha ko e faiaoga , ne fakakite e Iesu e fakaalofa ke he ua e puhala kehekehe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> He loved the truths he taught , and he loved the people he taught . <br>
(trg)="26"> Ne ofania e ia e kupu moli ne fakaako e ia , mo e ofania e ia e tau tagata ne fakaako e ia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Let us focus more closely on these two aspects of the pattern he set for us . <br>
(trg)="27"> Kia fakamahino fakatata atu a tautolu ke he tau puhala ua nei he fakafifitaki ne fakatoka e ia ma tautolu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> A Long - Standing Love of Divine Truths <br>
(trg)="28"> Ko e Fakaalofa Tu Leva he Tau Kupu Moli Faka - Atua <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> How did Jesus form a love for Jehovah’s teachings ? <br>
(trg)="29"> Feaki fefe e Iesu e fakaalofa ma e tau fakaakoaga ha Iehova ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> A teacher’s attitude toward his subject has a considerable bearing on the quality of his teaching . <br>
(trg)="30"> Ko e aga he faiaoga ke he matakupu hana kua lauia lahi e aoga he fakaakoaga hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> Any indifference will likely show and spread to his students . <br>
(trg)="31"> Ti , ko e ha fekehekeheaki to liga kitia mo e lauia ai ke he tau tagata fakaako hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> Jesus felt no apathy toward the precious truths he taught about Jehovah and His Kingdom . <br>
(trg)="32"> Kua nakai fakateaga a Iesu ke he tau kupu moli uho ne fakaako e ia hagaao ki a Iehova mo e Kautu Hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Jesus ’ love for this subject was profound . <br>
(trg)="33"> Ko e ofania ha Iesu ma e matakupu nei kua hokulo lahi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> He had formed that love as a student . <br>
(trg)="34"> Ne feaki e ia e fakaalofa nei ko e tagata fakaako . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Throughout the long ages of his prehuman existence , the only - begotten Son was an avid learner . <br>
(trg)="35"> Mai he tau vaha loa he moui ato tagata hana , ko e Tama fuataha ko e tagata fakaako makutu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Isaiah 50 : 4 , 5 records these fitting words : “ The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has given me the tongue of the taught ones , that I may know how to answer the tired one with a word . <br>
(src)="37"> He awakens morning by morning ; he awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones . <br>
(trg)="36"> Ne fakamau e Isaia 50 : 4 , 5 e tau kupu latatonu nei : “ Kua foaki mai he Iki ko Iehova kia au e alelo ha lautolu ne fakaako , ke iloa ai e au ke fakamafana ke he kupu a ia ne matematekelea ; to fafagu e ia au ke he pogipogi , ko e pogipogi to fafagu ai e ia haku a tau teliga , ke fanogonogo ai au tuga na lautolu kua fakaako . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear , and I , for my part , was not rebellious . <br>
(trg)="37"> Kua vevete he Iki ko Iehova haku a tau teliga , ti nakai totoko atu e au , ti nakai tukumuli au . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> 5 , 6 . ( a ) What experience did Jesus evidently have at his baptism , with what effect upon him ? <br>
(trg)="38"> 5 , 6 . ( a ) Ko e heigoa ne tupu ki a Iesu he papatisoaga hana , mo e lauia fefe ki a ia ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> ( b ) What contrast do we find between Jesus and Satan as to using God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="39"> ( e ) Ko e heigoa e kehe ne kitia e tautolu he vahaloto ha Iesu mo Satani ke he fakaaogaaga he Kupu he Atua ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> While growing up as a human on earth , Jesus continued to love divine wisdom . <br>
(trg)="40"> He tupu hake mo tagata he lalolagi , ne fakatumau a Iesu ke ofania e pulotu faka - Atua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Then , at the time of his baptism , he went through a unique experience . <br>
(trg)="41"> ( Luka 2 : 52 ) Ti , he magaaho he papatisoaga hana , ne fakafita a ia ke he taha mena kehe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> “ The heaven was opened up , ” says Luke 3 : 21 . <br>
(trg)="42"> “ Ati maihiua ai e lagi , ” he talahau he Luka 3 : 21 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Evidently , Jesus was then able to recall his prehuman existence . <br>
(trg)="43"> Maali ai , ko e mogoia ni ne maeke ia Iesu ke liu manatu e vaha ato tagata hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> Thereafter he spent 40 days fasting in the wilderness . <br>
(trg)="44"> He mole , ne fakaaoga e ia 40 e aho he fakakanopogi he tutakale . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> He must have found intense delight in meditating on the many heavenly sessions of instruction he had received from Jehovah . <br>
(trg)="45"> Liga ni kua fiafia lahi a ia ke manamanatu fakahokulo ke he tau magahala fakaako loga he lagi ne moua e ia mai ia Iehova . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> Before long , though , his love of God’s truths was put to the test . <br>
(trg)="46"> Ka e nakai leva , ne kamatamata ai e ofania hana ke he kupu moli he Atua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> When Jesus was fatigued and hungry , Satan sought to tempt him . <br>
(trg)="47"> He magaaho ne mategugu mo e hoge a Iesu , ne kumi e Satani ke kamatamata a ia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> What a contrast we find between these two sons of God ! <br>
(trg)="48"> Ko e kehe ha ia he vahaloto he tau tama ua nei he Atua ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Both quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures ​ — but with a completely different spirit . <br>
(trg)="49"> Ne fatiaki tokoua e laua mai he tau Tohiaga Tapu Heperu — ka e kehekehe katoatoa e tau agaga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> Satan twisted God’s Word , disrespectfully using it to serve his own selfish ends . <br>
(trg)="50"> Ne fakamamiko e Satani e Kupu he Atua , he fakaaoga fakahanoa ai ke moua aki e tau mena fulukovi hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> Really , that rebel had nothing but contempt for divine truths . <br>
(trg)="51"> Moli ni , ko e tagata totoko ia kua fakavihia lahi e tau kupu moli faka - Atua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> On the other hand , Jesus quoted the Scriptures with obvious love , using God’s Word carefully in each reply . <br>
(trg)="52"> Ke he taha fahi , ne fafati e Iesu e tau Tohiaga Tapu fakalataha mo e fakaalofa maaliali , he fakaaoga fakamitaki e Kupu he Atua ke foaki e tau tali takitaha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Jesus had been in existence long before those inspired words were first written down , yet he held them in reverence . <br>
(trg)="53"> Nukua leva e moui ha Iesu ato tohi hifo e tau kupu omoi he agaga ia , pete he pihia ne fakalilifu agaia e ia a lautolu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> They were precious truths from his heavenly Father ! <br>
(trg)="54"> Ha ko e tau kupu moli uho a ia mai he hana Matua he lagi ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> He told Satan that such words from Jehovah were more vital than food . <br>
(trg)="55"> Ne tala age a ia ki a Satani ko e tau kupu pihia mai ia Iehova kua mua atu e aoga ke he tau mena kai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Yes , Jesus loved all the truths that Jehovah had taught him . <br>
(trg)="56"> ( Mataio 4 : 1 - 11 ) E , ne ofania e Iesu e tau kupu moli oti ne fakaako e Iehova ki a ia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> How , though , did he display that love as a teacher ? <br>
(trg)="57"> Ka e , fakakite fefe e ia e fakaalofa ia ko e faiaoga ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Love for the Truths He Taught <br>
(trg)="58"> Fakaalofa ma e Tau Kupu Moli ne Fakaako e Ia <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Why did Jesus refrain from inventing his own teachings ? <br>
(trg)="59"> Ko e ha ne mataofi a Iesu he taute e tau fakaakoaga ni hana ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Jesus ’ love for the truths he taught was always apparent . <br>
(trg)="60"> Ko e fakaalofa ha Iesu ma e tau kupu moli ne fakaako e ia kua kitia maaliali tumau . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> After all , he might easily have developed his own ideas . <br>
(trg)="61"> Ha ko e mena , kua mukamuka ia ia ke feaki e tau manatu ni hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He possessed a vast repository of knowledge and wisdom . <br>
(trg)="62"> He kua toka ia ia e tanakiaga he iloilo mo e pulotu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> Nevertheless , he reminded his listeners again and again that everything he taught originated , not with himself , but with his heavenly Father . <br>
(trg)="63"> ( Kolose 2 : 3 ) Moha ia , ne liu fakamanatu tumau e ia e tau tagata fanogonogo hana ko e tau mena oti ne fakaako e ia kua mai , nakai ia ia , ka e he hana Matua he lagi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> He loved divine truths far too much to replace them with his own thinking . <br>
(trg)="64"> ( Ioane 7 : 16 ; 8 : 28 ; 12 : 49 ; 14 : 10 ) Kua lahi e ofania e ia e tau kupu moli faka - Atua ke hukui a lautolu aki e tau manatu ni hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> At the start of his ministry , how did Jesus set a pattern of relying on God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="65"> He kamataaga he hana fekafekauaga , puhala fe ne fakatoka e Iesu e fakafifitaki he falanaki ke he Kupu he Atua ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> When Jesus began his public ministry , he quickly set a pattern . <br>
(trg)="66"> He magaaho ne kamata e fekafekauaga ha Iesu ke he toloaga tagata , ne fakatoka fakamafiti e ia e fakafifitaki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> Consider the way he first declared to God’s people that he was the promised Messiah . <br>
(trg)="67"> Mailoga la e puhala ne fakapuloa fakamua e ia ke he tau tagata he Atua ko ia ko e Mesia ne mavehe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> Did he simply appear before crowds , proclaim himself Christ , and then perform spectacular miracles to prove his point ? <br>
(trg)="68"> Kua finatu kia a ia ki mua he moto tagata , fakapuloa ne ia ko e Keriso a ia , ti taute e tau mana ofoofogia ke fakamoli aki e manatu hana ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> No . <br>
(trg)="69"> Nakai . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> He went to a synagogue , where God’s people habitually read from the Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="70"> Ne finatu a ia ke he sunako , ko e kavi ne totou tumau he tau tagata he Atua e tau Tohiaga Tapu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> There he read aloud the prophecy of Isaiah 61 : 1 , 2 and explained that these prophetic truths applied to him . <br>
(trg)="71"> I ai , ne totou fakalahi e ia e perofetaaga he Isaia 61 : 1 , 2 mo e fakamaama kua hagaao e tau kupu moli fakaperofeta ia ki a ia ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> His many miracles helped to establish that he had Jehovah’s backing . <br>
(trg)="72"> ( Luka 4 : 16 - 22 ) Ne lagomatai ai he tau mana loga hana ke fakakite kua ha ha ia ia e lalago ha Iehova . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> Still , he always relied on God’s Word in his teaching . <br>
(trg)="73"> Pete ia , ne fakatumau a ia ke falanaki ke he Kupu he Atua ke he tau fakaakoaga hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> In his dealings with the Pharisees , how did Jesus show his loyal love for God’s Word ? <br>
(trg)="74"> He tau fehagaiaga hana mo e tau Farasaio , fakakite fefe e Iesu e fakaalofa fakamoli hana ma e Kupu he Atua ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> When Jesus was challenged by religious opponents , he did not engage them in a duel of wits , although he could easily have outdone them in such a contest . <br>
(trg)="75"> He magaaho ne paleko he tau tagata totoko fakalotu a Iesu , ne nakai lali a ia ke mua ki a lautolu , pete ni kua maeke ia ia ke fakakaumahala a lautolu ke he kamatamata pihia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> Rather , he let God’s Word refute them . <br>
(trg)="76"> Ka kua toka e ia e Kupu he Atua ke fakatikai a lautolu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> Recall , for instance , when the Pharisees charged that Jesus ’ followers had violated the Sabbath law by plucking a few heads of grain in a field and eating them while passing through . <br>
(trg)="77"> Ke tuga anei , manatu la e magaaho ne tukumale e tau Farasaio kua holitu he tau tutaki ha Iesu e fakatufono he Sapati he tau e tau fua saito he fonua mo e kai ai he o a lautolu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Jesus replied : “ Have you not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry ? ” <br>
(trg)="78"> Ne tali a Iesu : “ Nakai kia totou e mutolu e mena ne eke e Tavita , ka kua fia kai a ia , katoa mo lautolu ne fakalataha mo ia ? ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> Of course , those self - righteous men may well have read that inspired account recorded at 1 Samuel 21 : 1 - 6 . <br>
(trg)="79"> ( Mataio 12 : 1 - 5 ) Moli , kua liga totou he tau tagata fia tututonu ia e fakamauaga omoi he agaga he 1 Samuela 21 : 1 - 6 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> If so , they had failed to discern an important lesson that it contained . <br>
(trg)="80"> Kaeke pihia , kua kaumahala a lautolu ke mailoga e fakaakoaga aoga lahi ne toka i loto . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> Jesus , however , had done more than read the account . <br>
(trg)="81"> Ka kua mua e mena ne taute e Iesu mai he totou noa e fakamauaga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> He had thought about it and taken its message to heart . <br>
(trg)="82"> Ne manamanatu a ia hagaao ki ai mo e mauloto e ogo i loto . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> He loved the principles that Jehovah taught by means of that passage . <br>
(trg)="83"> Ne ofania e ia e tau matapatu fakaakoaga ne fakaako e Iehova he puhala he vala kupu ia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> So he used that account , as well as an example from the Mosaic Law , to reveal the balanced spirit of the Law . <br>
(trg)="84"> Ti fakaaoga ai e ia e fakamauaga ia , pihia foki mo e fifitakiaga mai he Fakatufono faka - Mose , ke fakakite e agaga lagotatai he Fakatufono . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> Similarly , Jesus ’ loyal love moved him to defend God’s Word against the efforts of religious leaders to twist it to their own ends or bury it under a morass of human traditions . <br>
(trg)="85"> Tatai foki , ne omoi he fakaalofa fakamoli ha Iesu a ia ke lalago e Kupu he Atua mai he laliaga he tau takitaki lotu ke fakamamiko ke aoga ai ni a lautolu po ke tanumia i lalo he tau aga fakamotu loga he tagata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> How did Jesus fulfill prophecies regarding the quality of his teaching ? <br>
(trg)="86"> Fakamoli fefe e Iesu e tau perofetaaga hagaao ke he uho he fakaakoaga hana ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> Jesus ’ love of his subject would never allow him to teach merely by rote , in a manner that was tired or mechanical . <br>
(trg)="87"> Ko e ofania ha Iesu ma e kupu moli to nakai fakaai ke fakaata a ia ke fakaako ai ke he puhala ako manatu , ke he puhala mateafu po ke taute noa ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="90"> Inspired prophecies had suggested that the Messiah would speak with ‘ charm on his lips , ’ using “ words of elegance . ” <br>
(trg)="88"> Ne talahau he tau perofetaaga omoi he agaga to vagahau e Mesia mo e ‘ tau kupu fakaalofa he hana tau laugutu , ’ he fakaaoga e “ tau kupu mitaki . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> Jesus fulfilled those prophecies by keeping his message fresh and alive , using “ winsome words ” as he taught the truths he so loved . <br>
(trg)="89"> ( Salamo 45 : 2 ; Kenese 49 : 21 ) Ne fakamoli e Iesu e tau perofetaaga ia he fakatumau ke fakaalaala e ogo hana , he fakaaoga e “ tau kupu fakaalofa ” he fakaako e ia e kupu moli ne ofania lahi e ia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> No doubt his enthusiasm animated his features , and his eyes shone with a lively interest in his subject . <br>
(trg)="90"> ( Luka 4 : 22 ) Nakai fakauaua , ne fakakikila he hana aga olioli e fofoga hana , mo e kua kikila hana tau mata mo e fiafia ke he matakupu hana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> What a pleasure it must have been to listen to him , and what a fine pattern for us to follow when we talk to others about what we have learned ! <br>
(trg)="91"> Liga ko e fiafia ha ia ke fanogonogo ki a ia , mo e ko e fakafifitaki mitaki ha ia ma tautolu ke mumuitua ki ai he magaaho ka tutala a tautolu ke he falu hagaao ke he mena ne ako e tautolu ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> Why did Jesus ’ abilities as a teacher never cause him to become puffed up with pride ? <br>
(trg)="92"> Ko e ha e lotomatala ha Iesu ko e faiaoga ne nakai taute a ia ke hula he fakatokoluga ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> Did Jesus ’ immense grasp of divine truths and his winning way with words induce him to become puffed up with pride ? <br>
(trg)="93"> Taute nakai he lotomatala lahi ha Iesu ke he kupu moli faka - Atua mo e hana puhala vagahau fakafuluola a ia ke hula he fakatokoluga ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> That often happens in the case of human teachers . <br>
(trg)="94"> Ko e mena fa tupu a ia ke he tau faiaoga tagata . <br>
<hr>
(src)="97"> Remember , though , that Jesus was wise in a godly way . <br>
(trg)="95"> Ka e manatu kua pulotu a Iesu ke he puhala mahani Atua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="98"> Such wisdom does not allow for haughtiness , for “ wisdom is with the modest ones . ” <br>
(trg)="96"> Ko e pulotu pihia kua nakai fakaata ma e fakaikaluga , ha ko e ‘ pulotu kia lautolu ne fakatokolalo . ’ <br>
<hr>
(src)="99"> There was something else that kept Jesus from turning proud or haughty . <br>
(trg)="97"> ( Tau Fakatai 11 : 2 ) Kua fai mena foki ne mataofi a Iesu he hula po ke fakaikaluga . <br>
