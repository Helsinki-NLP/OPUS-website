(trg)="1"> U TSIKBALIL IN KUXTAL <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> As told by Olivier Hamel <br>
(trg)="2"> Tsikbaltaʼab tumen Olivier Hamel <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="3"> Tu jaʼabil 1975 le yaanten kaʼapʼéel jaʼaboʼ in maamaeʼ tu tsʼáaj cuenta yaan baʼax uchaʼanten . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="4"> Le u méekʼmen kaʼachoʼ juntúul u amigaeʼ tu lúuʼsaj junpʼéel baʼal aal . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Mother noticed that I did not even flinch . <br>
(trg)="5"> Kex kʼaʼam úuchik u juumeʼ mix tin kíitsʼkʼabtinbaiʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="6"> Ka tu tsʼáajten óoxpʼéel jaʼabeʼ láayliʼ maʼ jóokʼok in tʼaaneʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Letiʼ túun ka aʼalaʼab tiʼ in láakʼtsiloʼob tumen le doctoroʼoboʼ teneʼ jach kóoken . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> While I was still an infant , my parents divorced , and Mother was obliged to raise me and my older siblings ​ — two brothers and a sister — ​ alone . <br>
(trg)="8"> Desde tin chichnileʼ in maamaeʼ tu divorciartuba tiʼ in taata , le oʼolal chéen tu juunal tu líiʼsoʼon , teen , in kiik , yéetel in kaʼatúul sukuʼunoʼob . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>
(trg)="9"> Kaʼacheʼ utiaʼal u kaʼansaʼal le mejen paalal kóokoʼob tu luʼumil Franciaoʼ jach ku beetaʼal u muʼyajoʼob . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Still , since childhood I have had an advantage that many deaf people do not have . <br>
(trg)="10"> Baʼaleʼ teneʼ yaan junpʼéel baʼax jach tu yáanten tin paalil . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Let me explain . <br>
(trg)="11"> Paʼatik in tsolikteʼex . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="12"> Utiaʼal yaʼab j - kaʼansajoʼob kaʼacheʼ le mejen paalal kóokoʼoboʼ kʼaʼabéet u kanik u naʼatoʼob baʼax ku kaʼansaʼaltiʼob chéen ikil u yilkoʼob bix u péeksik u chiʼ máak . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="13"> Tin paalileʼ mix tu escuelailoʼob Francia ku chaʼabal u meyaj señas tiʼ máak . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons . <br>
(trg)="14"> Yaan mejen paalaleʼ hasta ku kʼaʼaxal u kʼaboʼob paachil tiʼob tu yorail le xookoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="15"> Teʼ jaʼaboʼoboʼ ku xáantal táan u tsʼaʼabalten terapia tuláakal le semanaʼoboʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="16"> Kin maʼachal tin kamaʼach wa tin pooleʼ , kin obligartaʼal in beet ka juumnak in kaal kex maʼ tu páajtal in wuʼuyik . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="17"> Mix tu páajtal kaʼach in biskinba yéetel in wéet paaliloʼob . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="18"> Jach muʼyajnajen teʼ jaʼaboʼoboʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="19"> Seis jaʼaboʼob yaanten ka kʼuʼuben xook tiʼ junpʼéel internado utiaʼal kóokoʼob . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="20"> Yáax in wilik uláakʼ paalal jeʼex tenoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="21"> Baʼaleʼ láayliʼ maʼ tu chaʼabal u meyaj señas tiʼ máakeʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>
(trg)="22"> Tak chéen béechʼ joʼol ka k - beeteʼ jeʼel u jaʼatsʼaʼal k - kʼab wa u kóolaʼal u tsoʼotsel k - pooleʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> However , we signed in secret , using codes we invented . <br>
(trg)="23"> Baʼaleʼ le maʼ táan k - ilaʼaloʼ k - tʼanikba yéetel le señas k - inventartikoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="24"> Bey páajchajik in tsikbal yéetel uláakʼ paalaloʼ yéetel bey káajik kanpʼéel jatsʼuts jaʼaboʼoboʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> When I was ten , however , I was moved to a primary school with hearing children . <br>
(trg)="25"> Baʼaleʼ le ka tu tsʼáajten 10 jaʼaboʼobeʼ túuxtaʼaben tiʼ junpʼéel primaria tuʼux minaʼan kóokoʼobiʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="26"> ¡ Jach táaj lúub in wóol ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="27"> Tin tukleʼ kíim tuláakal le uláakʼ paalal kóokoʼoboʼ yéetel chéen teen pʼáaten . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="28"> In láakʼtsiloʼobeʼ maʼ tu kanoʼob señasiʼ tumen le doctoroʼoboʼ tu yaʼaloʼobeʼ wa ku beetkoʼob beyoʼ chéen kunel le terapia tsʼaʼabtenoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(trg)="29"> Le oʼolal xan maʼ tu chaʼajoʼob in biskinba yéetel uláakʼ paalal kóokoʼobiʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="30"> Kʼajaʼanteneʼ le ka bisaʼaben yiknal juntúul doctoreʼ tin wilaj junpʼéel u libroil señas yóokʼol u escritorio . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> When I saw the pictures on the cover , I pointed to it and said , “ I want that ! ” <br>
(trg)="31"> Le ka tin wilaj u dibujoil le librooʼ tin tuchʼubteʼ ka tin waʼalaj : « ¡ In kʼáat leloʼ ! » . <br>

(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="34"> In maamaeʼ tu yilaj u líiʼskoʼon jeʼex u kaʼansik le Bibliaoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="35"> Ku biskoʼon kaʼach tu múuchʼulil Mérignac , le tuʼux ku muchʼkuba u j - jaajkunajoʼob Jéeoba naatsʼ tu kaajil Burdeosoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="36"> Maʼ tin jach naʼatik kaʼach le baʼax ku kaʼansaʼaloʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="37"> Baʼaleʼ le j - Jaajkunajoʼoboʼ ku turnarkubaʼob utiaʼal u tsʼíibtikoʼob yéetel u yeʼeskoʼobten le baʼax ku kaʼansaʼaloʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="38"> Le yaabilaj tu yeʼesoʼobtenoʼ jach kʼuch tin puksiʼikʼal . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="39"> In maama xaneʼ ku tsʼáaikten xook yéetel le Bibliaoʼ , baʼaleʼ maʼ tin jach naʼatik kaʼach le baʼax ku kaʼansiktenoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="40"> Tin wuʼuyinba jeʼex profeta Daniel ka tsʼaʼab u náayt junpʼéel baʼal tumen juntúul angeloʼ ; letiʼeʼ tu yaʼalaj : « Tin wuʼuyaj baʼax tu yaʼalaj baʼaleʼ maʼ tin naʼataj mix baʼaliʼ » ( Daniel 12 : 8 ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> Teneʼ ‹ tin wilaj , baʼaleʼ maʼ tin naʼataj mix baʼaliʼ › . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="42"> Kex beyoʼ jujunpʼíitil tin kanil le baʼaxoʼob maas kʼaʼanaʼantak ku kaʼansik le Bibliaoʼ , ka tin wilaj in tsʼáaikoʼob ichil in kuxtal . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> I treasured up what I clearly understood and tried to apply it in my life . <br>
(trg)="43"> Kaanbalnajen xan tiʼ u modos le j - Jaajkunajoʼoboʼ , jeʼex le paciencia ku yaʼalik le Biblia kʼaʼabéet u yantal tiʼ máakoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="44"> Teneʼ maʼ tin jach naʼatik kaʼach baʼax le modosaʼ tak le ka tin wilaj bix u yeʼesaʼal tumen le j - Jaajkunajoʼoboʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="45"> Letiʼobeʼ jach tu jaajil tu yáantenoʼob . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="46"> Juntéenjeak tin táankelmileʼ tin wilaj uláakʼ táankelmoʼob kóokoʼob táan u tʼaanoʼob ich señas . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(trg)="47"> Káaj in biskinba tu yéeteloʼob sin ke in wilaʼal tumen u maasil yéetel káaj in kanik lenguaje de señas francés . <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> I started associating with them in secret and began to learn French Sign Language ( FSL ) . <br>
(trg)="48"> Maʼ xuʼul in bin teʼ muchʼtáambaloʼoboʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> I continued to attend Christian meetings , where one young Witness , Stéphane , took me under his wing . <br>
(trg)="49"> Teʼeloʼ tin kʼaj óoltaj Stéphane , juntúul j - Jaajkunaj tu beetuba in amigo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> He made great efforts to communicate with me , and I felt a strong bond with him . <br>
(trg)="50"> Letiʼeʼ tu kaxtaj bix jeʼel u tʼaan tin wéeteleʼ ; teneʼ jach kʼuchen in yaabilte . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> However , a bitter disappointment awaited me . <br>
(trg)="51"> Maʼ in wojel kaʼach baʼax kun úuchliʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>
(trg)="52"> Stéphaneʼ kʼaʼal cárcel tumen maʼ tu yóotaj u beet u soldadoiliʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="53"> ¡ Jach lúub in wóol ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="54"> Le tiaʼan Stéphane teʼ carceloʼ óolak xuʼuluk in bin muchʼtáambal . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> Eleven months later , Stéphane was released and came back home . <br>
(trg)="55"> Once meses tiʼ leloʼ Stéphaneʼ jóokʼ cárcel . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="56"> Chéen tukult bukaʼaj kiʼimakchajik in wóol le ka joʼopʼ u tsikbal Stéphane ich señas tin wéeteloʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> I could not believe my eyes ! <br>
(trg)="57"> ¡ Maʼ tu páajtal kaʼach in creertik ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> What had happened ? <br>
(trg)="58"> ¿ Bix tu beetil ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="59"> Le tiaʼan kaʼach carceleʼ tu kanaj lenguaje de señas francés . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="60"> Le ka tin wilaj bix u péeksik u kʼaboʼob yéetel u táan u yicheʼ jach táaj kiʼimakchaj in wóol . <br>
(trg)="61"> ¡ Beoraaʼ kin naʼatik baʼax ku yaʼalik ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="62"> Stéphaneʼ káaj u xokik le Biblia tin wéeteloʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="64"> Tin paalileʼ jach uts tin wich in chaʼantik u dibujoil le libroʼob yéetel revistaʼoboʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="65"> Kʼajaʼanteneʼ kin jach ilik kaʼach bix beetaʼanik le dibujoʼob utiaʼal maʼ u tuʼubultenoʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="66"> In wojel kaʼach yanchaj Abraham , u « chʼiʼibal » yéetel le junmúuchʼ « yaʼabkach máakoʼob [ oʼ ] » , baʼaleʼ chéen páajchaj in naʼatik tubeel úuchik u tsoʼololten ich señas ( Génesis 22 : 15 - 18 ; Apocalipsis 7 : 9 ) . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="67"> Bey tin kaxtilak le idioma ku kʼuchul tin puksiʼikʼaloʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="68"> Desde teʼ kʼiin jeʼeloʼ káaj in naʼatik le baʼax ku kaʼansaʼal teʼ muchʼtáambaloʼoboʼ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="70"> Stéphaneʼ tu yáanten in maas naʼat le baʼax ku yaʼalik le Bibliaoʼ ka okjaʼanajen tu jaʼabil 1992 utiaʼal in weʼesik tsʼoʼok in kʼubik in kuxtal tiʼ Jéeoba Dios . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="71"> Kex beyoʼ tumen maʼ páajchaj in biskinba yéetel uláakʼ máakoʼob tin paalileʼ pʼáat suʼlaken . <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> Eventually , the small group of deaf people I was with was combined with a congregation in Pessac , a suburb of Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="72"> Ka máan kʼiineʼ le grupo tiʼ señas tuʼux yanenoʼ nuʼup tiʼ u múuchʼulil Pessac , junpʼéel colonia tu kaajil Burdeos . <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> That was very helpful , and I continued to make spiritual progress . <br>
(trg)="73"> Leloʼ tu yáanten utiaʼal in maas meyajtik Dios . <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
(trg)="74"> Kex chan talam in biskinba yéetel u maasileʼ in amigoʼob maʼ kóokoʼobeʼ jach tu yáantenoʼob utiaʼal in naʼatik baʼax ku yaʼalaʼalten . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> One couple , Gilles and Elodie , made special efforts to communicate with me . <br>
(trg)="75"> Gilles yéetel Elodie u yataneʼ jach tu tsʼáaj u yóol u biskubaʼob tin wéetel . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> They often invited me to share a meal or have a cup of coffee with them after the meetings , thus developing a wonderful friendship . <br>
(trg)="76"> U suukileʼ ken tsʼoʼokok le muchʼtáambaloʼ ku invitartikenoʼob janal wa ukʼ café . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> What a joy to be among people who follow God’s loving ways ! <br>
(trg)="77"> Lelaʼ tu beetaj k - bisikba maʼalob . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> My wife , Vanessa , is a real support to me <br>
(trg)="78"> ¡ Jach jatsʼuts u yantal máak yéetel máaxoʼob ku beetkoʼob baʼax ku yaʼalik Dios ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> It was in this congregation that I met the charming Vanessa . <br>
(trg)="79"> Teʼ múuchʼuliloʼ tin kʼaj óoltaj Vanessa , juntúul x - kiʼichpan chʼúupal jach uts u modos . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I was attracted by her sensitivity and sense of justice . <br>
(src)="83"> She never viewed my deafness as a barrier but , rather , as an enriching personal experience for her . <br>
(trg)="80"> Maʼ tu tuklaj wa tumen kóokeneʼ jeʼel u talamtal u biskuba tin wéeteleʼ , baʼaxeʼ tuukulnaj tiʼ le baʼaxoʼob jeʼel u páajtal u kanikoʼ . <br>

(trg)="81"> Jach utschaj tin wicheʼ , ka tsʼoʼok k - beel tu jaʼabil 2005 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Even though communication is not my strong point , Vanessa has helped me to fight my timidity and to express myself more openly . <br>
(trg)="82"> Kex talam in waʼalik baʼax kin tuklikeʼ , Vanessaeʼ jach ku yáantken utiaʼal in biskinba maʼalob yéetel u maasil . <br>

<hr>
(src)="87"> The year we got married , the France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Louviers invited me to come for a month of training for translation work . <br>
(trg)="84"> Teʼ jaʼab tsʼoʼok k - beeloʼ invitartaʼaben junpʼéel mes tu sucursal u j - jaajkunajoʼob Jéeoba tu luʼumil Francia tu kaajil Louviers utiaʼal u kaʼansaʼalten bix jeʼel in suttʼaan ich señaseʼ . <br>
