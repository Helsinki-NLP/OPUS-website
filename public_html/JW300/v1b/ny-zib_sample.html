(trg)="2"> BASICALLY there are three ways to manage money : ( 1 ) Spend it , ( 2 ) save it , or ( 3 ) give it away . <br>
(trg)="3"> Let us first discuss how to spend money wisely . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Tiyeni choyamba tikambirane mmene mungagwiritsire ntchito ndalama mwanzeru . <br>
(trg)="4"> If the Great Recession has highlighted nothing else , it has shown the wisdom of living on a well - planned budget . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> Vuto la kusayenda bwino kwa chuma padziko lonse lathandiza anthu kuona kuti kukhala ndi bajeti n’kofunika kwambiri . <br>
(trg)="5"> What is a budget ? <br>
(trg)="6"> Simply put , it is an estimate of how income will be used , whether by an individual , a family , a business , or a government . <br>
(trg)="7"> A Family Project <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> Kodi bajeti ndi chiyani ? <br>
(trg)="8"> How can you plan a budget ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> Mwachidule tingati bajeti ndi kuoneratu mmene mudzagwiritsire ntchito ndalama zanu . <br>
(trg)="9"> “ All family members , ” says the book Budgeting , by Denise Chambers , “ should be included in drawing up the plan so that all have a commitment to the family budget . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Bajeti ikhoza kukhala ya munthu payekha , banja , kampani kapena boma . <br>
(trg)="10"> Periodically , all should get together to see how their budget is working . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> Muzichitira Limodzi Bajeti <br>
(trg)="12"> To work out a budget , some people use a computer program . <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> Kodi n’chiyani chingakuthandizeni kupanga bajeti ? <br>
(trg)="14"> One column is for income , and the other for expenditures . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Buku lina lolembedwa ndi Denise Chambers , linanena kuti : “ Popanga bajeti pa banja panu , aliyense azikhalapo chifukwa zimenezi zimathandiza kuti aliyense aziyesetsa kutsatira bajetiyo . ” <br>
(trg)="16"> A time - tested method of budgeting is based on the use of envelopes or folders labeled “ Food , ” “ Rent , ” “ Transportation , ” “ Electricity , ” “ Medical Bills , ” and so forth . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Nthawi ndi nthawi , onse pa banjapo ayenera kukumana n’kuona ngati akutsatira bajetiyo kapena ayi . <br>
(trg)="17"> In the past , people put cash for those expenses in the envelopes each month . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> Kupanga bajeti n’kothandiza chifukwa aliyense amayesetsa kuti asawononge ndalama zambiri kuposa zimene banjalo limapeza . <br>
(trg)="18"> Now many feel it is safer and easier to deposit money in a bank account and withdraw it as needed . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Popanga bajeti , ena amagwiritsa ntchito pulogalamu ya pa kompyuta . <br>
(trg)="19"> Jonathan and Anne , who live in South Africa with their two daughters , often use the folder method of budgeting . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> Ena amalemba bajetiyo papepala limene amaligawa mbali ziwiri . <br>
(trg)="20"> “ If your salary is deposited in a bank account , ” says Jonathan , “ it is just as important to be strict about how your money is divided . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Mbali imodzi amalembapo ndalama zimene amapeza ndipo mbali inayo amalembapo ndalama zimene amawononga . <br>
(trg)="21"> For example , if you run out of your monthly allowance for meat , then you should not take money set aside for savings to buy more meat . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Popanga bajeti zimathandizanso kwambiri kuganizira ndalama zimene zimafunika kamodzi pachaka monga ndalama zolipira msonkho kapena ndalama zopitira kutchuthi . <br>
(trg)="22"> Jonathan used to run a business , but now he and his family have chosen to be volunteer workers and are involved in building places of worship . <br>
(trg)="23"> Because they treasure this life of giving , they need to live on a budget more than ever . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Njira imene anthu akhala akuigwiritsa ntchito kwa zaka zambiri ndi yokhala ndi maenvulopu angapo kapena mafaelo olembedwa kuti “ Zakudya , ” “ Lendi , ” “ Thilansipoti , ” “ Magetsi , ” “ Zolipilira Kuchipatala , ” ndi zina zotero . <br>
(trg)="25"> The Greater Happiness <br>
(trg)="26"> Studies show that giving of resources to others , including time and energy as well as some money , brings a greater happiness . <br>
(trg)="27"> To the extent your resources allow , it can be the best of the three options mentioned in the introduction . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> Kale anthu ankaika ndalama zogwiritsira ntchito pa zinthu zimenezi m’maenvulopuwo . <br>
(trg)="28"> Chris Farrell , in his book The New Frugality , says that savings are “ a means of supporting spending . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Koma masiku ano anthu ambiri amaona kuti ndi bwino kukaika ndalama kubanki , n’kumazitengako akafuna kulipirira zinthuzo . <br>
(trg)="30"> * Farrell adds : “ When you think about what matters most , it’s usually relationships , experiences , and the sense of making a difference , not money and possessions . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Jonathan ndi mkazi wake Anne , omwe amakhala ku South Africa , komanso ana awo awiri aakazi , amakhala ndi faelo imene amalembamo bajeti yawo yonse . <br>
(trg)="31"> Michael Wagner , an economist , seems to agree . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> Jonathan ananena kuti : “ Ngakhale ngati malipiro anu mumalandirira kubanki , muyenera kuonetsetsa kuti ndalama iliyonse imene mukutenga ndi yogwiritsiradi ntchito pa zinthu zimene munalemba pabajeti paja . <br>
(trg)="32"> In his book , Your Money , Day One , aimed at motivating youths to save , he states : “ When you take it upon yourself to help those who are less fortunate , that kindness and generosity will come back to you in a variety of positive ways , but most rewarding is the feeling you will experience in your heart by helping your fellow man . ” <br>
(trg)="33"> The Bible acknowledges that giving results in happiness . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Mwachitsanzo , ngati ndalama zogulira nyama zatha , musamatenge ndalama zimene munasunga n’cholinga choti mukagulire nyama ina . ” <br>
(trg)="34"> As discussed earlier , the Bible contains sayings that can help you manage your resources wisely . <br>
(trg)="35"> Now , consider seven more of these wise sayings . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> Poyamba Jonathan ankachita bizinezi koma panopa iye ndi banja lake amagwira ntchito yongodzipereka yomanga malo olambirira . <br>
(trg)="36"> [ Footnote ] <br>
(trg)="37"> Money can be given away in the form of gifts or hospitality such as preparing meals for friends and family . <br>
(trg)="38"> Seven Wise Saying <br>

(trg)="39"> THE sayings below are found in an ancient book filled with maxims that have proved to be practical and up - to - date . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> Banjali limakumana nthawi ndi nthawi n’cholinga choti lione ngati pangafunike kusintha bajetiyo pena ndi pena . <br>

(trg)="47"> Those words were written by the apostle Paul , who gave up a prominent career and became a follower of Jesus Christ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> Pa njira zitatu zimene zatchulidwa kumayambiriro kwa nkhaniyi , kuthandiza ena kukhoza kukhala njira yabwino kwambiri yogwiritsira ntchito ndalama zanu . <br>
(trg)="48"> Unlike some religious leaders today , Paul firmly resisted any temptation to take material advantage of his students or associates . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Chris Farrell analemba m’buku lake kuti : “ Kusunga ndalama kumathandiza kuti tizitha kuthandiza anthu ena . <br>
(trg)="49"> Instead , he could honestly say : “ I have coveted no man’s silver or gold or apparel . <br>
<hr>

(trg)="51"> “ Who of you that wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense , to see if he has enough to complete it ? ” <br>
(trg)="52"> Jesus ’ illustration might be applied to a situation you may face : When making a purchase , especially with a credit card , will you buy impulsively or be patient and count the cost ? <br>
(trg)="53"> Do you really need the item , and can you afford it ? <br>
(trg)="54"> “ Those who borrow are slaves of moneylenders . ” <br>
(trg)="55"> The recent world financial crisis has exposed the folly of credit - card and other forms of debt . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Katswiri wina wa zachuma , dzina lake Michael Wagner , ananena kuti mfundo imeneyi ndi yabwino kuitsatira . <br>
(trg)="56"> “ It is common for a person today to have , on average , over $ 9,000 in credit card debt on four or more credit cards , ” states Michael Wagner in his 2009 book Your Money , Day One . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> Polimbikitsa achinyamata kuti aphunzire kusunga ndalama , iye analemba m’buku lake kuti : “ Munthu ukachitira ena zabwino , anthu enanso amakuchitira zabwino zambirimbiri , komanso chosangalatsa n’chakuti umamva bwino kwambiri mumtima . ” <br>
(trg)="57"> “ The wicked one is borrowing and does not pay back , but the righteous one is showing favor and is making gifts . ” <br>
