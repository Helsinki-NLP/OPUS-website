(src)="3"> I was two years old in 1975 when my mother first suspected that there was something unusual about me . <br>
(trg)="3"> Mami aamenyire atĩ ndĩ na gathĩna ndĩ na mĩaka ĩrĩ mwaka wa 1975 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> As mother held me in her arms , a friend dropped a heavy object on the floor , making a loud bang . <br>
(trg)="4"> Mami aanyitĩte , mũratawe nĩ agũithirie kĩndũ kĩritũ thĩ kĩrĩa kĩagambire na hinya . <br>

(src)="6"> By the age of three , I was still unable to talk . <br>
(trg)="6"> Ndiamenyete kwaria o na ndĩ na mĩaka ĩtatũ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Then my family heard the shocking news ​ — specialists confirmed that I was totally deaf ! <br>
(trg)="7"> Thutha ũcio famĩlĩ itũ nĩ yaheirũo ndũmĩrĩri ya kũmakania — arigitani makiuga atĩ niĩ ndaarĩ bubu biũ ! <br>

<hr>
(src)="9"> At that time , deaf children in France were not educated the way they are today , and the methods used sometimes resulted in much suffering . <br>

(trg)="11"> Na nĩ ngũũtaarĩria . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> When I was about five years old <br>
(src)="13"> For some time , many educators believed that deaf children should be taught by using speech and lip - reading . <br>
(trg)="12"> Kwa ihinda rĩna - rĩ , arutani aingĩ meetĩkĩtie atĩ ciana iria bubu ciaagĩrĩirũo nĩ gũthomithio na njĩra ya gũciruta kũrora mĩromo ya mũrutani . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> In fact , in France , where I grew up , signing was absolutely forbidden in school . <br>
(trg)="13"> Thĩinĩ wa Faranja kũrĩa ndaarereirũo , kwaria na rũthiomi rwa ciĩko thĩinĩ wa cukuru warĩ ũndũ wakananĩtio biũ . <br>

(trg)="14"> Ciana imwe o na nĩ cioohagwo moko na thutha rĩrĩa irĩ kĩrathi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> For the first few years of my life , I spent several hours each week with a speech therapist . <br>
(trg)="15"> Mĩaka ĩigana ũna ndĩ mũnyinyi , nĩ ndaarutagwo mathaa maigana ũna o kiumia nĩ mũrigitani wa mĩgambo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> I was held by the jaw or the head and obliged to produce again and again sounds that I could not hear . <br>
(trg)="16"> Ndanyitagwo rũthĩa kana kĩongo na ngahatĩkwo mũno ndute mĩgambo ĩrĩa itaahotaga nginya kũmĩigua . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> I was not able to communicate with other children . <br>

(src)="19"> Those were years of suffering for me . <br>
(trg)="18"> Harĩ niĩ , ĩyo yarĩ mĩaka ya kũnyamarĩka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Then , at the age of six , I was sent to a specialized boarding school . <br>
(trg)="19"> Thutha ũcio ndĩ wa mĩaka ĩtandatũ , nĩ ndaatwarirũo cukuru ya gũkoma ya bubu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> For the first time , I came into contact with other deaf children . <br>
(trg)="20"> Kũu nĩ kuo ndacemanirie na ciana ingĩ bubu rĩa mbere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Here , too , sign language was forbidden . <br>
(trg)="21"> O nakuo kũu gũtietĩkĩrĩtio kwaria na rũthiomi rwa ciĩko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If we gestured in class , we risked having our knuckles rapped or our hair pulled . <br>

(trg)="23"> O na kũrĩ ũguo no twaragia na hitho tũkĩhũthĩra ciĩko citũ cia gwĩtungĩra . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> At last , I was able to communicate with other children . <br>
(trg)="24"> Macũngĩrĩro - inĩ ngĩhota kwaranĩria na ciana iria ingĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> So began four happy years . <br>
(trg)="25"> Ũcio warĩ mwambĩrĩrio wa mĩaka 4 ya gĩkeno . <br>

<hr>
(src)="28"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="27"> Ũndũ ũcio nĩ wanjũragire ngoro mũno ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> I thought that all the other deaf children had died and that I was the only one left in the world . <br>
(trg)="28"> Ndonire ciana iria ingĩ bubu ciothe ta ciakua ngĩtigwo nyiki thĩinĩ wa thĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Following the advice of doctors , who feared that I might lose the benefits of speech therapy , my family had not learned to sign and I was not allowed to associate with deaf children . <br>
(trg)="29"> Nĩ ũndũ wa kũrũmĩrĩra ũtaaro wa arigitani arĩa meciragia atĩ nĩ ngũũrũo nĩ ũguni ũrĩa umanaga na kũrutwo nĩ arigitani a mĩgambo - rĩ , andũ thĩinĩ wa famĩlĩ itũ matigana kwĩruta rũthiomi rwa ciĩko na ndietĩkagĩrio gũtwarana na ciana ingĩ iria ciarĩ bubu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I still remember a visit to a hearing specialist . <br>
(src)="32"> He had a sign - language book on his desk . <br>
(trg)="30"> Nĩ ndirikanaga mũthenya ũmwe thiĩte kũrĩ mũrigitani ũmwe wa matũ , na metha - inĩ yake haarĩ na ibuku rĩa rũthiomi rwa ciĩko . <br>

(src)="36"> Mother tried to bring us children up by Christian principles . <br>
(trg)="34"> Mami nĩ aageririe biũ gũtũrera akĩhũthĩra motaaro ma Gĩkristiano . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> She took us to the meetings of the Mérignac Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses , near Bordeaux . <br>
(trg)="35"> Nĩ aatũtwaraga mĩcemanio thĩinĩ wa Kĩũngano kĩa Aira a Jehova kĩa Mérignac gũkuhĩ na Bordeaux . <br>

(src)="38"> As a child , I understood very little at meetings . <br>
(trg)="36"> Ndĩ mwana , ndaataũkagĩrũo nĩ maũndũ manyinyi mũno mĩcemanio - inĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> However , different ones there took turns sitting next to me to write notes about what was being said . <br>
(trg)="37"> O na kũrĩ ũguo , andũ ngũrani ngũrani nĩ maacenjanagia gũikarania na niĩ nĩguo manyandĩkagĩre ũhoro ũrĩa warutanagwo . <br>

(src)="40"> I was touched by their love and concern . <br>
(trg)="38"> Nĩ ndaahutagio mũno nĩ wendo wao na kũnjaĩra . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> At home , Mother studied the Bible with me , but I never fully grasped what I was being taught . <br>
(trg)="39"> Tũrĩ mũciĩ mami nĩ aandutaga Bibilia ĩndĩ ndigana gũtaũkĩrũo biũ nĩ kĩrĩa aandutaga . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> I felt a bit like the prophet Daniel , who , after receiving a prophecy from an angel , said : “ I heard , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="40"> Ndaiguaga ta mũnabii Danieli , ũrĩa thutha wa kũheo ũrathi nĩ mũraika , oigire ũũ : “ Ngĩkĩigua maũndũ macio , no ndigana kũmenya gĩtũmi kĩamo . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> For me , it was a case of “ I saw , but I could not understand . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> ( Danieli 12 : 8 ) Harĩ niĩ , “ nĩ ndonaga no ndiataũkagĩrũo . ” <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> Nonetheless , basic Bible truths slowly took root in me . <br>
(trg)="42"> O na gũtariĩ ũguo , kahora kahora morutani ma mũthingi ma Bibilia nĩ mekĩrire mĩri ngoro - inĩ yakwa . <br>
<hr>

(src)="46"> I also learned from observing the behavior of others . <br>
(trg)="44"> Ningĩ nĩ ndeerutaga na njĩra ya kũrora ciĩko cia andũ arĩa angĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> For example , the Bible tells us to be patient . <br>
(trg)="45"> Kwa ngerekano - rĩ , Bibilia nĩ ĩtwĩraga tũkoragwo tũrĩ akirĩrĩria . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> That did not mean much to me . <br>
(trg)="46"> Ndiataũkagĩrũo ũkirĩrĩria nĩ kĩĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> However , by watching my fellow believers display this quality , I was able to understand what patience is . <br>
(trg)="47"> Ĩndĩ , na njĩra ya kũrora ũkirĩrĩria wa Akristiano arĩa angĩ , nĩ ndaataũkĩirũo nĩguo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Truly , the Christian congregation has been of great benefit to me . <br>
(trg)="48"> Hatarĩ nganja , kĩũngano gĩa Gĩkristiano gĩkoretwo kĩrĩ ũguni mũnene mũno harĩ niĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Stéphane helped me to understand the Bible <br>
(src)="52"> One day , when I was in my teens , I saw some deaf youths in the street signing to each other . <br>
(trg)="49"> Ndĩ tinĩnja , harĩ mũthenya ndonire andũ ethĩ bubu makĩaranĩria na rũthiomi rwa ciĩko barabara - inĩ . <br>

(trg)="50"> Ngĩambĩrĩria gũceeraga nao na hitho na ngĩambĩrĩria kwĩruta Rũthiomi rwa Kwaria na Ciĩko rwa Kĩfaranja . <br>

(src)="57"> Stéphane was imprisoned for maintaining his Christian neutrality . <br>

<hr>
(src)="58"> I was devastated ! <br>
(trg)="55"> Nĩ ndaakuire ngoro mũno ! <br>

(src)="59"> With Stéphane gone , I became deeply discouraged and virtually stopped attending meetings . <br>
(trg)="56"> Thutha wa Stéphane kuohwo , ndahinyĩrĩrĩkire mũno nginya ngĩtiga gũthiĩ mĩcemanio ĩmwe . <br>
<hr>

(trg)="57"> Thutha wa mĩeri ikũmi na ũmwe , Stéphane nĩ ohorirũo na agĩcoka mũciĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Imagine my surprise when Stéphane began communicating with me using sign language . <br>
(trg)="58"> Ta hũra mbica ũrĩa ndaaiguire rĩrĩa Stéphane aanjarĩirie na rũthiomi rwa ciĩko rĩa mbere . <br>
<hr>

(src)="64"> In prison , Stéphane had learned FSL . <br>
(trg)="61"> Eerutĩte Rũthiomi rwa Kwaria na Ciĩko rwa Kĩfaranja arĩ njera . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I watched Stéphane’s hand movements and facial expressions , and my excitement grew as I contemplated all that this would mean for me . <br>
(trg)="62"> Ndarora Stéphane akĩhũthĩra moko na ũthiũ wake , ngĩigua njanjamũkĩte mũno ndeciria ũrĩa ũndũ ũcio ũngĩakorirũo na ũguni mũnene harĩ niĩ . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Stéphane started to study the Bible with me . <br>
(trg)="63"> Stéphane nĩ aambĩrĩirie kũnduta Bibilia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> It was from then on that I began to patch together all the pieces of Bible truth that I had retained . <br>
(trg)="64"> Hĩndĩ ĩyo nĩrĩo ndambĩrĩirie gũtaũkĩrũo nĩ ma cia Bibilia iria nderutĩte hau kabere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> As a child , I loved to look at the beautiful pictures in our Bible publications , comparing the characters and examining every detail in order to impress the stories on my mind . <br>
(trg)="65"> Ndĩ mũnini nĩ ndendete kwĩrorera mbica thaka mabuku - inĩ maitũ marĩa makoragwo na ũhoro umĩte Bibilia - inĩ , ngaciringithania na maũndũ marĩa marĩ ho nĩguo ũndũ ũcio ũingĩre biũ meciria - inĩ makwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I knew about Abraham , his “ seed , ” and the “ great crowd , ” but it was only when I saw these concepts explained in sign language that they took on real meaning . <br>
(trg)="66"> Nĩ ndamenyete ũhoro wa Iburahimu , “ mbeũ ” yake , na “ kĩrĩndĩ kĩingĩ , ” no ndaataũkĩirũo nĩ maũndũ macio wega biũ o rĩrĩa ndonire magĩtaarĩrio na rũthiomi rwa ciĩko . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> It was evident that I had found my natural language , the language of my heart . <br>
(trg)="67"> ( Kĩambĩrĩria 22 : 15 - 18 ; Kũguũrĩrio 7 : 9 ) Hatarĩ nganja rũu nĩruo rũthiomi rũrĩa ndaabataraga , rũrĩa ndaataũkagĩrũo kũna . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> Now that I could understand what was said at the meetings , my heart was touched and my thirst for knowledge grew . <br>
(trg)="68"> Rĩu tondũ nĩ ingĩahotire gũtaũkĩrũo nĩ maũndũ marĩa maarutanagwo mĩcemanio - inĩ , ngoro yakwa nĩ yahutagio mũno na merirĩria ma kũgĩa na ũmenyo makĩongerereka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> With Stéphane’s help , my understanding of the Bible continued to grow , and in 1992 , I dedicated my life to Jehovah God and was baptized . <br>
(trg)="69"> Kũgerera ũteithio wa Stéphane , ũtaũku wakwa wa Bibilia nĩ wathire na mbere kuongerereka , na mwaka wa 1992 nĩ ndeyamũrĩire Jehova Ngai na ngĩbatithio . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> Despite the progress I had made , however , not having been able to communicate in my early years left me introverted and cautious . <br>
(trg)="70"> Gũkinyĩria hĩndĩ ĩyo no ndaarĩ na guoya wa gũtukana na andũ tondũ ndiagĩire na mweke ũcio ndĩ mũnini . <br>

(src)="76"> Though I was still struggling with my limited ability to communicate , my hearing friends were careful to make sure that I understood everything . <br>
