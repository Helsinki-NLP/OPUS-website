<hr>
(src)="33"> Perhaps to indicate what was to come , Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic . ​ — See the footnotes to Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>

(src)="37"> This translation , thought to have been done by 72 translators , became known as the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="40"> Chu Bible lehlin chu Septuagint tia koh a ni a . <br>

(src)="40"> Translation reportedly began in Egypt in the third century B.C.E . and may have been finished by 150 B.C.E . <br>
(trg)="43"> * ( Footnote en rawh . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> This translation is still important , as it gives scholars insight into the meaning of certain obscure Hebrew words and passages . <br>
(trg)="44"> Ṭhenkhatin Hebrai Pathian Lehkha Thu aṭanga a ngial a ngana an lehchhuah laiin , mi dangte erawh chuan chutiangin an let lo va . <br>

(src)="44"> What language did Jesus likely use to teach his disciples ? <br>
(trg)="46"> Isua’n a zirtîrte zirtîr nân eng ṭawng nge a hman ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> When God’s firstborn came to earth , he likely spoke and taught in what the Bible calls Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="47"> Isua leia a awm lai khân , Hebrai ṭawng a hman ngei a rinawm a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(trg)="48"> ( Johana 19 : 20 ; 20 : 16 ; Tirhkohte 26 : 14 ) Chutih hun laia lâr Aramaic ṭawngkam ṭhenkhat pawh hman châng a nei ve ngei bawk ang . <br>

<hr>
(src)="48"> In addition , Greek and Latin were spoken in Israel . <br>
(src)="49"> The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages . <br>
(trg)="50"> ( Luka 4 : 17 - 19 ; 24 : 44 , 45 ; Tirhkohte 15 : 21 ) Chutih lai chuan Grik ṭawng leh Latin ṭawngte pawh hman ni mah se , Bible - in Isua’n chu ṭawngte a hman thu a sawi lang lo . <br>
(trg)="51"> 8 , 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>
(trg)="52"> Engvângin nge Kristian tam takin Grik ṭawng an hman a , chu chuan Pathian Jehova chungchâng eng nge min zirtîr ? <br>

(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>
(trg)="54"> ( Tirhkohte 6 : 1 chhiar rawh . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="55"> Chanchin ṭha a darh zêl chuan , Kristian tam takte chuan Hebrai ṭawng aiin Greek ṭawng an hmang zâwk a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="56"> Grik chu ṭawng tuallêng a nih avângin Matthaia , Marka , Luka , leh Johana lehkhabute chu Grik ṭawnga theh darh a ni . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Thus , the language of many disciples was Greek rather than Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="57"> * ( Footnote en rawh . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="58"> Tirhkoh Paula lehkha thawnte leh Bible bu dangte chu Grik ṭawnga ziak a ni bawk . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(src)="58"> What does this indicate about Jehovah ? <br>
(trg)="59"> Kristian Grik Pathian Lehkha Thu ziaktute’n Hebrai Pathian Lehkha Thu an lâk chhâwn hian Septuagint Bible an hmang ṭhîn a , chu chu a ngaihvenawm hle . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="60"> A châng chuan , chûng an lâk chhâwnte chu atîra Hebrai thu mal an rem dân nên chhe têin a inang lo va . <br>

(trg)="61"> Chuvângin , ṭha famkimlo ṭawnglettute hna thawh chu tûn laia kan Bible neihah a tel ta a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="62"> Hei hian , Pathian Jehova chuan ṭawng chi khat emaw , hnam pakhat emaw chu a dangte aia ṭha zâwk angin a thlîr lo tih min zirtîr a ni . — Trihkohte 10 : 34 chhiar rawh . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="63"> Pathian Jehova’n mihringte a biak pawh dân aṭangin eng nge kan hriat ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Our brief review of God’s communication with humans teaches us that Jehovah communicates according to need and circumstances . <br>
(trg)="64"> Pathian Jehova’n mihringte chu dinhmun azirin a be pawh tih kan hre tawh a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>
(trg)="65"> Ani chuan amah leh a thil tumte kan hriat theih nân ṭawng chi khat hman bîk nei tûrin min beisei lo . <br>

(trg)="66"> ( Zakaria 8 : 23 ; Thupuan 7 : 9 , 10 chhiar rawh . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Jehovah directed the inspiration of the Bible , but he allowed it to be presented in different styles . <br>
(trg)="67"> Bible ziaktute chu Jehova’n a thlarauvin a thâwk khum tih kan hre bawk a ; mahse , mahni irâwm chhuaka an ziah a phal a ni . <br>

(trg)="69"> Engvângin nge mihringte’n ṭawng chi hrang hrang an hman chu Jehova tân harsatna a tlin loh ? <br>
<hr>

(trg)="70"> Mihringte’n ṭawng chi hrang hrang hmang mah se , chu chu Jehova tân harsatna a tling lo . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> No . <br>

(trg)="72"> Bible - ah hian Isua ṭawngkam hman tlêm tê chu a ngai ngaiin a lang a . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> However , Jehovah made sure that Jesus ’ message was transmitted in Greek and , in time , in other languages . <br>

(src)="75"> How was the transmission of the Bible opposed ? <br>
(trg)="77"> Engtin nge Bible chuan beihna a tawh ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> Producing the Bible in many languages thwarted the efforts of such men as Roman Emperor Diocletian , who in 303 C.E . ordered that all copies of the Scriptures be destroyed . <br>
(trg)="78"> Mihring chanchinah hian Bible letlingtute leh sem chhuaktute chuan vawi tam tak beih an tâwk a . <br>
