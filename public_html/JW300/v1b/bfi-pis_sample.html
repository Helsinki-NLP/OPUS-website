(src)="25"> He later made his thoughts known to Hebrew - speaking Bible writers , such as Moses , Samuel , and David , and they expressed these thoughts in their own words and style . <br>

(trg)="34"> Taem olketa Israelite kamap free from Babylon , samfala iusim nao Aramaic languis for story long olketa narawan . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Perhaps to indicate what was to come , Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic . ​ — See the footnotes to Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>
(trg)="35"> Maet hem nao why Daniel , Jeremiah , and Ezra raetem samfala scripture long Aramaic languis . — Lukim olketa footnote long Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> How did God’s Word become available in languages other than Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="36"> Why nao olketa transleitim olketa Hebrew Scripture go long Greek languis ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Alexander the Great later conquered much of the ancient world , and common , or Koine , Greek became an international language . <br>
(trg)="37"> Taem Alexander the Great tekovarem staka ples long world , main languis wea staka pipol iusim hem Greek languis wea olketa kolem Koine . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Many Jews began to speak that language , leading to the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek . <br>
(trg)="38"> Staka Jew start for story long Greek languis , and gogo olketa transleitim olketa Hebrew Scripture go long Greek languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> This translation , thought to have been done by 72 translators , became known as the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="39"> Datfala transleison nao olketa kolem Septuagint . <br>

(src)="38"> It was the first translation of the Bible and one of the most important . <br>

(src)="39"> Septuagint means “ Seventy . ” <br>
(trg)="41"> Olketa savveman sei 72 - fala man nao transleitim Septuagint . <br>

(src)="44"> What language did Jesus likely use to teach his disciples ? <br>
(trg)="44"> Wanem languis nao Jesus iusim for teachim olketa disaepol ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> When God’s firstborn came to earth , he likely spoke and taught in what the Bible calls Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="45"> Taem Jesus stap long earth , luk olsem hem story long Hebrew languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(trg)="46"> And maet hem iusim tu samfala toktok long Aramaic languis wea staka pipol long datfala taem iusim . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> However , he also knew the ancient Hebrew of Moses and the prophets , which was read each week in the synagogues . <br>
(trg)="47"> Bat hem savve gud tu long Hebrew languis bilong bifor wea Moses and olketa profet iusim for raetem olketa Holy Raeting , wea olketa Jew readim long olketa sinagog evri week . <br>

(trg)="48"> Samfala pipol long taem bilong Jesus story long Greek and Latin languis , bat Bible no sei sapos Jesus tu hem story long olketa languis hia . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages . <br>
(trg)="49"> 8 , 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>
(trg)="50"> Why nao olketa raetem samfala Bible buk long Greek languis , and wanem nao diswan showimaot abaotem Jehovah ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Jesus ’ early followers knew Hebrew , but after his death , his disciples spoke other languages . <br>
(trg)="51"> Olketa firstfala Christian story long Hebrew languis , bat bihaen Jesus dae , olketa disaepol story long olketa nara languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>

<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="53"> Taem pipol long staka ples herem gud nius , staka pipol wea kamap Christian olketa story long Greek languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="54"> From staka Christian story long Greek languis , Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John raetem Gospel bilong olketa long Greek languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="55"> * And tu , aposol Paul and olketa narawan , raetem olketa Bible buk long Greek languis . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(src)="58"> What does this indicate about Jehovah ? <br>
(trg)="56"> Staka long olketa wea raetem olketa Christian Greek Scripture iusim Septuagint taem olketa quotem olketa Hebrew Scripture . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="57"> Samfala taem olketa quote hia hem lelebet difren from wanem olketa raetem long Hebrew languis firstaem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> These quotations , which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording , are now part of the inspired Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="58"> So samting wea olketa transleita wea no perfect olketa raetem , hem kamap part bilong Bible wea iumi garem distaem . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="59"> Datwan showimaot Jehovah hem no favorim eni culture or languis . — Readim Acts 10 : 34 . <br>

(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="60"> Wanem nao iumi lanem from wei wea Jehovah story long pipol long languis bilong olketa ? <br>

(trg)="61"> Iumi storyim finis wanem Jehovah duim for story long pipol long languis bilong olketa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>

(trg)="64"> Iumi storyim tu olketa wea raetem Bible olketa raetem tingting bilong God , bat Jehovah letem olketa for iusim toktok bilong olketa seleva . <br>

(src)="67"> Why have language differences not hindered God’s communication with people ? <br>
(trg)="65"> Nomata olketa man story long staka difren languis , why nao datwan no stopem Jehovah for story long olketa ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> Has God’s communication with humans been hindered by the use of different languages and minor variations in translation ? <br>
