<hr>
(src)="12"> Jehovah has intimate knowledge of billions of intelligent creatures , earthly and heavenly . <br>
(trg)="15"> Yehova waziŵa vosi vakukwaskana ndi ŵanthu kweniso angelu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> At any given moment , countless individuals may be praying to him in many languages . <br>

(trg)="18"> Kweni pa nyengu so yeniyi , wapereka ulongozgi ndi kukambiskana ndi angelu . <br>

(src)="15"> To accomplish this , his thoughts , language , and communication must be vastly superior to those of humans . <br>

(src)="16"> ( Read Isaiah 55 : 8 , 9 . ) <br>
(trg)="20"> ( Ŵerengani Yesaya 55 : 8 , 9 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Clearly , when Jehovah communicates with humans , he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts so that man can understand them . <br>
(trg)="21"> Asani Yehova wakhumba kulongoro ndi ŵanthu , wakamba nawu mu mazu ngapusu kuti avwi . <br>

(src)="23"> Jehovah communicated with Adam in the garden of Eden , using human language . <br>
(trg)="28"> Pavuli paki , walongoronga ndi ŵanthu nge Mosese , Samuele ndi Davidi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> God likely did so in an ancient form of Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="29"> Ŵanthu yaŵa angulemba mu Chihebere vo Chiuta wanguŵakambiya . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> He later made his thoughts known to Hebrew - speaking Bible writers , such as Moses , Samuel , and David , and they expressed these thoughts in their own words and style . <br>
(trg)="30"> Chinanga kuti angulemba m’mazu ngawu , kweni ngenga maŵanaŵanu ngaku Chiuta . <br>

<hr>
(src)="29"> Did Jehovah insist that his people use only Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="36"> Kumbi Yehova walongoronga ndi ŵanthu ŵaki mu Chihebere pe ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> Explain . <br>
(trg)="37"> Konkhoskani . <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> As circumstances changed , God did not restrict his communication with humans to Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="38"> Vinthu vati vasintha , Chiuta walongoronga ndi ŵanthu mu Chihebere pe cha . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> After the Babylonian exile , Aramaic became the everyday language of some of God’s people . <br>
(trg)="39"> Ŵanthu aku Chiuta ŵati awe ku Babiloni , anyaki angwamba kulongoro Chiaramu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Perhaps to indicate what was to come , Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic . ​ — See the footnotes to Ezra 4 : 8 ; 7 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 11 ; and Daniel 2 : 4 . <br>
(trg)="40"> Panyaki ndichu chifukwa chaki Yehova wangukambiya mchimi Daniele , Yeremiya ndi wasembi Ezra kulemba vigaŵa vinyaki va m’Bayibolu mu Chiaramu . <br>

(src)="34"> How did God’s Word become available in languages other than Hebrew ? <br>
(trg)="42"> Nchifukwa wuli Malemba nga Chihebere ngangufwatulikiya mu Chigiriki ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Alexander the Great later conquered much of the ancient world , and common , or Koine , Greek became an international language . <br>
(trg)="43"> Pavuli paki , Alekezandara Mura wanguthereska vyaru vinandi . <br>
(trg)="44"> Ivi vinguchitiska kuti ŵanthu anandi kusazgapu Ayuda , ayambi kulongoro Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> Many Jews began to speak that language , leading to the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek . <br>
(trg)="45"> Ndichu chifukwa chaki Malemba nga Chihebere ngangufwatulikiya mu Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> This translation , thought to have been done by 72 translators , became known as the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="46"> Bayibolu ili lidanika Septuagint ndipu anyaki akamba kuti lingufwatulikiya ndi ŵanthu 72 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> It was the first translation of the Bible and one of the most important . <br>
(trg)="47"> Ili lenga Bayibolu lakwamba kufwatulika ndipu ndakukhumbika ukongwa . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> Translation reportedly began in Egypt in the third century B.C.E . and may have been finished by 150 B.C.E . <br>
(trg)="48"> * Chifukwa chakuti wo angufwatuliya Bayibolu ili ŵenga anandi , angulifwatuliya mwakupambanapambana . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> This translation is still important , as it gives scholars insight into the meaning of certain obscure Hebrew words and passages . <br>
(trg)="49"> Chinanga kuti venga viyo , Ayuda wo alongoronga Chigiriki awonanga kuti Bayibolu la Septuagint ndi Mazu Ngaku Chiuta . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> The work of so many translators resulted in varied translation styles , from literal to rather free . <br>
(trg)="50"> Pavuli paki , Akhristu nawu aliwonanga so viyo . <br>
(trg)="51"> Kumbi Yesu watenere kuti waŵasambizanga mu chineneru wuli akusambira ŵaki ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> Nevertheless , the Septuagint was viewed as God’s Word by Greek - speaking Jews and later by Christians . <br>
(trg)="52"> Mwana wakwamba waku Chiuta wati waza panu pasi , watenere kuti walongoronga ndi kusambiza mu Chihebere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> What language did Jesus likely use to teach his disciples ? <br>
(trg)="53"> Chihebere cho chakambikanga mu nyengu yaku Yesu chitenere kuti chenga chakusazanikana ndi Chiaramu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> When God’s firstborn came to earth , he likely spoke and taught in what the Bible calls Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="54"> Mwaviyo , Yesu watenere so kuti wasazgangamu Chiaramu pakulongoro . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> First - century Hebrew was evidently influenced by Aramaic , so Jesus may have used some Aramaic expressions . <br>
(trg)="55"> Kweni waziŵanga so Chihebere cha mu nyengu yaku Mosese ndi achimi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> However , he also knew the ancient Hebrew of Moses and the prophets , which was read each week in the synagogues . <br>
(trg)="56"> Chihebere ichi chaŵerengekanga sabata yeyosi mumasinagogi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> In addition , Greek and Latin were spoken in Israel . <br>
(trg)="57"> Kweniso , ŵanthu alongoronga Chigiriki ndi Chilatini ku Yisraele . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages . <br>
(trg)="58"> Bayibolu likamba cha kuti Yesu nayu walongoronga vineneru ivi . <br>
(trg)="59"> 8 , 9 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> As Christianity spread , why was Greek the primary language used among God’s people ? <br>
(trg)="60"> Chikhristu chati chayamba kuwanda , nchifukwa wuli akusambira anandi angwamba kulongoro Chigiriki , ndipu ivi vilongo kuti Yehova ndi Chiuta wamtundu wuli ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Jesus ’ early followers knew Hebrew , but after his death , his disciples spoke other languages . <br>
(trg)="61"> Akusambira aku Yesu alongoronga Chihebere . <br>
(trg)="62"> Kweni iyu wati wafwa , angwamba kulongoro so vineneru vinyaki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> ( Read Acts 6 : 1 . ) <br>
(trg)="63"> ( Ŵerengani Machitidu 6 : 1 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek . <br>
(trg)="64"> Chikhristu chati chayamba kuwanda , Akhristu anandi alongoronga Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="65"> Ndipu mabuku nga Mateyu , Marko , Luka ndi Yohane ngo ngakamba vo Yesu wasambizanga ndi kuchita , ngangulembeka mu Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> Thus , the language of many disciples was Greek rather than Hebrew . <br>
(trg)="66"> Mwaviyo , akusambira anandi alongoronga Chigiriki m’malu mwa Chihebere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> The letters of the apostle Paul and the other inspired books were also distributed in Greek . <br>
(trg)="67"> * Makalata ngaku Paulo ndi mabuku nganyaki ngangulembeka so mu Chigiriki . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Some feel that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew and that it was then translated into Greek , perhaps by Matthew himself . <br>
(src)="58"> What does this indicate about Jehovah ? <br>
(trg)="68"> Ŵanthu wo angulemba Malemba nga Chigiriki asani akhumba kulemba mazu nga mu Malemba nga Chihebere , kanandi angatonga mu Bayibolu la Septuagint . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures , they usually did so from the Septuagint . <br>
(trg)="69"> Nyengu zinyaki , mazu yanga ngapambananga kamanavi ndi mo angungalembe mu Malemba nga Chihebere . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> These quotations , which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording , are now part of the inspired Scriptures . <br>
(trg)="70"> Kweni ntchitu yakufwatuliya yo ŵanthu ambula urunji anguchita yinguja chigaŵa cha Mazu Ngaku Chiuta . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> Thus , the work of imperfect human translators became part of the inspired Word of God , a God who does not favor one culture or language over another . ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 . <br>
(trg)="71"> Iyu watanjiya chineneru cha pamwenga mudawuku . — Ŵerengani Machitidu 10 : 34 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> What can we conclude about Jehovah’s making his Word available to people ? <br>
(trg)="72"> Kumbi tasambiranji pa nkhani ya mo Yehova wakambiskiyana ndi ŵanthu ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> Our brief review of God’s communication with humans teaches us that Jehovah communicates according to need and circumstances . <br>
(trg)="73"> Kufika yapa , tasambira kuti Chiuta wasintha chineneru cho wakambiskiyana ndi ŵanthu mwakukoliyana ndi mo vinthu viliri . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> He does not insist that we learn a specific language in order for us to get to know him or his purposes . <br>
(trg)="74"> Iyu wakhumba cha kuti tosi tisambiri chineneru chimoza kuti timuziŵi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> ( Read Zechariah 8 : 23 ; Revelation 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
(trg)="75"> ( Ŵerengani Zekariya 8 : 23 ; Chivumbuzi 7 : 9 , 10 . ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> Jehovah directed the inspiration of the Bible , but he allowed it to be presented in different styles . <br>
(trg)="76"> Tasambira so kuti Yehova wangutuma ŵanthu kuti alembi Bayibolu , kweni wanguŵazomerezga kuti alilembi m’mazu ngawu . <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> Why have language differences not hindered God’s communication with people ? <br>
(trg)="77"> Kumbi Chiuta wasuzgika kukambiskana ndi ŵanthu chifukwa chakuti alongoro vineneru vakupambanapambana ? <br>
