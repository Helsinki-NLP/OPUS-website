Kako Posadite and Grow brusnicami iz semen
<hr/>
How to Plant and Grow Cranberries from Seeds<br/>
Kako Posadite and Grow brusnicami iz semen
<hr/>
Cranberry plants (Vaccinium macrocarpon) are low-growing, berry-producing vine-like shrubs that are native to regions in eastern North America.<br/>
Brusnic rastline (Vaccinium macrocarpon) so nizko rastoča, berry za proizvodnjo vinske trte, kot grmi, ki so avtohtone regije v vzhodni Severni Ameriki.
<hr/>
They are usually grown in sandy, acid-rich soil with bog-like growing conditions.<br/>
Običajno so zrasla na peščenih, kislina bogata tla z barje podobnih rastnih razmerah.
<hr/>
Growing cranberries from seed requires perseverance and commitment, since the seeds can require a long period of time before germinating.<br/>
Pridelovanje brusnice iz semena zahteva vztrajnost in predanost, ker se semena potrebujejo dolgo časa, preden kali.
<hr/>
Step 1: Fill 3- or 4-inch wide pots with enough lime-free sterilized growing medium to fill the pots to within about 1/4 of an inch from the top of the rim.<br/>
Korak 1: Izpolnite 3- ali 4-palčni široki lonci z dovolj apna brez sterilizirano rastni substrat za polnjenje posode za v približno 1/4 na centimeter od zgornjega obroča.
<hr/>
Step 2: Firm down the soil in each of the planting pots using your fingers, a piece of wood or a metal spoon.<br/>
Korak 2: Podjetje dol tleh v vseh lončkih za sajenje s prsti, kos lesa ali kovine žlico.
<hr/>
Transfer all the pots into an irrigation or watering tray.<br/>
Prenesti vse lončke v namakalnega ali zalivanje pladenj.
<hr/>
The tray should be able to hold about 2 inches of water.<br/>
Pladenj mora biti omogočeno, da ima približno 2 centimetrov vode.
<hr/>
Step 3: Pour enough water into the tray so the growing medium in the pots will soak up the water and become well-moistened.<br/>
Korak 3: Pour dovolj vode v predal, tako da bo rastni substrat v loncih vpijejo vodo in se dobro navlažena.
<hr/>
Pack the soil down one final time.<br/>
Pakiranje zemljo navzdol en končni čas.
<hr/>
Pour out the remainder of the water, if there is any.<br/>
Izliti ostanek vode, če obstaja.
<hr/>
Step 4: Poke two to three 1/4-inch-deep holes in each pot.<br/>
Korak 4: Suniti 02:58 1/4-inch-deep luknje v vsakem loncu.
<hr/>
Drop two cranberry seeds into each of the holes.<br/>
Spustite dve brusnični semena v vsako od lukenj.
<hr/>
Sprinkle over the top of each pair of seeds approximately 1/4 inch of the growing media.<br/>
Potresemo po vrhu vsak par semen približno 1/4 centimeter rastočih medijev.
<hr/>
Step 5: Place the tray of pots in a location in your home that will stay consistently around 65 to 70 degrees F for four weeks.<br/>
Korak 5: Postavite pladenj loncev na mesto v vašem domu, ki bo dosledno ostati okoli 65 za 70 stopinj F za štiri tedne.
<hr/>
Provide as much bright light as possible but, if possible, not direct sunlight.<br/>
Zagotoviti toliko močni svetlobi, kot je mogoče, vendar, če je mogoče, ni neposredna sončna svetloba.
<hr/>
Keep the growing medium moist in each of the pots; add water to the tray as needed.<br/>
Imejte rastni substrat vlažen v vsaki od loncev; dodamo vodo v zbiralno posodo, kot je potrebno.
<hr/>
Step 6: Transfer the tray of pots into a location where the temperature will be between 25 and 40 degrees F for six weeks.<br/>
Korak 6: Prenos pladenj loncev na mestu, kjer se bo temperatura med 25 in 40 stopinj F za šest tednov.
<hr/>
Maintain the moisture levels by adding water to the tray when required.<br/>
Vzdrževanje vlago z dodajanjem vode pladenj po potrebi.
<hr/>
The temperature change is beneficial to hasten germination.<br/>
Sprememba temperature je koristno, da bi pospešili kalitev.
<hr/>
Step 7: Put the tray of pots into an area where the temperature will stay fairly consistent between 40 and 55 degrees F. Leave the tray of pots in this location for germinating the cranberry seeds.<br/>
Korak 7: Postavite pladenj loncev na območje, kjer se bo temperatura ostanejo dokaj konsistenten 40 in 55 stopinj F. Pustite pladenj loncev na tej lokaciji za kali brusnično semena.
<hr/>
Germination of cranberry seeds can begin in as little as three weeks, or can take several months.<br/>
Kalivost semen brusnice se lahko začne v manj kot treh tednih, ali lahko traja več mesecev.
<hr/>
Transplant the cranberry seedlings into their permanent location outside after they’ve become well-established.<br/>
Presaditev brusnični sadike v svojo stalno lokacijo zunaj, potem ko so postali uveljavljeno.
