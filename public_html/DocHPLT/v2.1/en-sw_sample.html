Starting Seeds: Additional potassium and calcium might be needed to spur good fruit development.<br/>
Kuanzia Mbegu:Potasiamu ya ziada na kalsiamu yapate zinahitajika kukuza matunda mazuri ya maendeleo.
<hr/>
Potassium and calcium help produce nice thick pepper walls that not only taste better but also resist fruit rot.<br/>
Potassium na msaada kalsiamu kuzalisha kuta nzuri pilipili nene kwamba si tu ladha bora lakini pia kupinga matunda kuoza.
<hr/>
These nutrients should be added when turning under the remnants of the year’s garden.<br/>
Madini hayo lazima aliongeza wakati kugeuka chini ya mabaki ya bustani ya mwaka.
<hr/>
We always plant a cover crop, such as clover or wheat, which stabilizes our raised beds through the winter.<br/>
Sisi daima kupanda zao la bima, kama vile clover au ngano, ambayo haijatulia wetu vitanda kukulia kupitia majira ya baridi.
<hr/>
When we turn the cover under in spring, it decomposes and provides most of the nitrogen the peppers need.<br/>
Wakati sisi kugeuka bima chini katika spring, ni hutengana na hutoa zaidi ya nitrojeni pilipili haja.
<hr/>
Seedlings Transplanting: Seeds need feed and heat.<br/>
Miche Upandikizaji: Mbegu haja malisho na joto.
<hr/>
Eight weeks before transplanting, we start our seeds in a well-drained potting mix and keep them moist and warm (70° to 80°F) to ensure good germination.<br/>
Wiki nane kabla ya kupanda, sisi kuanza mbegu zetu katika mchanganyiko pamoja na mchanga potting na kuwaweka unyevu na joto (70° hadi 80 ° F) kuhakikisha ukuaji mzuri.
<hr/>
We use a heating mat under the seedling flats.<br/>
Sisi kutumia kitanda joto chini ya kujaa miche.
<hr/>
But any consistently warm place, above the refrigerator for instance, works.<br/>
Lakini sehemu yoyote mfululizo joto, juu ya jokofu kwa mfano, kazi.
<hr/>
Plants need to be separated in the seed flat by at least 2 in. for best growth.<br/>
Mimea haja ya kuwa na kutengwa katika gorofa mbegu kwa angalau 2 katika. kwa ajili ya ukuaji bora.
<hr/>
After the first true leaves develop, we start fertilizing with a balanced liquid solution such as a fish emulsion and kelp mixture.<br/>
Baada ya kwanza majani ya kweli kuendeleza, sisi kuanza kupandishia na ufumbuzi uwiano kioevu kama vile samaki na Emulsion mchanganyiko kelp.
<hr/>
Closely watch the cotyledons—the seed leaves that appear before the first true leaves.<br/>
Karibu kuangalia cotyledons-majani ya mbegu ambayo hujitokeza kabla ya majani ya kwanza ya kweli.
<hr/>
They should be vibrant and green.<br/>
Wanapaswa kuwa mahiri na kijani.
<hr/>
Yellow cotyledons, for example, indicate insufficient nitrogen.<br/>
Za cotyledons, kwa mfano, zinaonyesha nitrojeni haitoshi.
<hr/>
It’s best to gradually expose transplants to the outdoors for a week or two prior to setting them out.<br/>
Ni bora hatua kwa hatua nje ya upandikizaji kwa nje kwa wiki moja au mbili kabla ya kuweka yao nje.
<hr/>
Schritt 4: Stoßen zwei vor drei 1/4-inch-deep Löcher in jedem Topf.<br/>
Hatua 4: Poke mashimo 1/4-inch-deep 2-3 katika sufuria ya kila aina.

How to Plant and Grow Cranberries from Seeds<br/>
Jinsi ya Kupanda na kukua Cranberries kutoka Mbegu
<hr/>
How to Plant and Grow Cranberries from Seeds<br/>
Jinsi ya Kupanda na kukua Cranberries kutoka Mbegu
<hr/>
Cranberry plants (Vaccinium macrocarpon) are low-growing, berry-producing vine-like shrubs that are native to regions in eastern North America.<br/>
Cranberry mimea (Vaccinium macrocarpon) ni chini kuongezeka, berry-huzalisha mzabibu-kama vichaka kwamba ni wenyeji wa mikoa katika mashariki ya Amerika ya Kaskazini.
<hr/>
They are usually grown in sandy, acid-rich soil with bog-like growing conditions.<br/>
Wao ni kawaida mzima katika mchanga, asidi tajiri wa ardhi na hali ya kuumiza vichwa-kama kuongezeka.
<hr/>
Growing cranberries from seed requires perseverance and commitment, since the seeds can require a long period of time before germinating.<br/>
Kuongezeka cranberries kutoka kwa mbegu inahitaji uvumilivu na kujitolea, tangu mbegu inaweza kuhitaji kipindi cha muda mrefu kabla ya kuota.
<hr/>
Step 1: Fill 3- or 4-inch wide pots with enough lime-free sterilized growing medium to fill the pots to within about 1/4 of an inch from the top of the rim.<br/>
Hatua 1: Kujaza 3- au 4-inch pana sufuria na kati ya kutosha chokaa-bure sterilized kuongezeka kujaza sufuria ndani ya kuhusu 1/4 ya inchi kutoka juu ya mdomo.
<hr/>
Step 2: Firm down the soil in each of the planting pots using your fingers, a piece of wood or a metal spoon.<br/>
Hatua 2: Kampuni chini ya udongo katika kila moja ya sufuria ya upandaji kutumia vidole, kipande cha mbao au kijiko chuma.
<hr/>
Transfer all the pots into an irrigation or watering tray. The tray should be able to hold about 2 inches of water.<br/>
Kuhamisha sufuria wote katika tray umwagiliaji au kumwagilia. tray wanapaswa kuwa na uwezo wa kushikilia kuhusu 2 inchi ya maji.
<hr/>
Step 3: Pour enough water into the tray so the growing medium in the pots will soak up the water and become well-moistened.<br/>
Hatua 3: Kumwaga maji ya kutosha ndani ya tray hivyo kati ya kupanda katika sufuria itakuwa loweka juu ya maji na kuwa vizuri laini.
<hr/>
Pour out the remainder of the water, if there is any.<br/>
Pakiti udongo chini wakati moja ya mwisho. Kumwaga mabaki ya maji, kama kuna.
<hr/>
Step 4: Poke two to three 1/4-inch-deep holes in each pot.<br/>
Hatua 4: Poke mashimo 1/4-inch-deep 2-3 katika sufuria ya kila aina.
<hr/>
Drop two cranberry seeds into each of the holes.<br/>
Kuacha mbegu cranberry mbili katika kila moja ya mashimo.
<hr/>
Sprinkle over the top of each pair of seeds approximately 1/4 inch of the growing media.<br/>
Kuinyunyiza juu ya juu ya kila jozi ya mbegu takriban 1/4 inchi ya vyombo vya habari kuongezeka.
<hr/>
Step 5: Place the tray of pots in a location in your home that will stay consistently around 65 to 70 degrees F for four weeks.<br/>
Hatua 5: Nafasi ya tray ya sufuria katika eneo katika nyumba yako kwamba kukaa mfululizo karibu 65 kwa 70 digrii f kwa wiki nne.
<hr/>
Provide as much bright light as possible but, if possible, not direct sunlight.<br/>
Kutoa kama mwanga mkali sana kama inawezekana lakini, kama inawezekana, si moja kwa moja jua.
<hr/>
Keep the growing medium moist in each of the pots; add water to the tray as needed.<br/>
Kuendelea kukua kati unyevu katika kila moja ya sufuria; kuongeza maji kwenye tray kama inahitajika.
<hr/>
Step 6: Transfer the tray of pots into a location where the temperature will be between 25 and 40 degrees F for six weeks.<br/>
Hatua 6: Kuhamisha tray ya sufuria ndani ya mahali ambapo joto itakuwa kati ya 25 na 40 digrii F kwa muda wa wiki sita.
<hr/>
Maintain the moisture levels by adding water to the tray when required. The temperature change is beneficial to hasten germination.<br/>
Kudumisha viwango vya unyevu na kuongeza maji kwa tray wakati required. mabadiliko ya hali ya joto ni manufaa kwa kuharakisha kuota.
<hr/>
Step 7: Put the tray of pots into an area where the temperature will stay fairly consistent between 40 and 55 degrees F. Leave the tray of pots in this location for germinating the cranberry seeds.<br/>
Hatua 7: Kuweka tray ya sufuria ndani ya eneo ambapo hali ya joto kukaa uungwana thabiti kati ya 40 na 55 digrii F. Kuondoka tray ya sufuria katika eneo hili kwa germinating mbegu cranberry.
<hr/>
Germination of cranberry seeds can begin in as little as three weeks, or can take several months.<br/>
Ukuaji wa mbegu cranberry unaweza kuanza katika wiki kama kidogo kama tatu, au unaweza kuchukua miezi kadhaa.
