If you receive your seeds in or after the summer, we recommend sowing the seeds in the autumn this year.<br/>
Ak dostanete semienka alebo po lete, odporúčame výsev semien na jeseň tohto roku.
<hr/>
Stored seeds require one month stratification at about 37 degree Fahrenheit and are best sown as early as possible in the year.<br/>
Uložené Tayberry semená vyžadujú jeden mesiac rozvrstvenie okolo 37 stupeň Fahrenheita a najlepšie vysievajú čo najskôr v roku.
<hr/>
Here is a general guide to stratify and plant the blackberries seeds:<br/>
Tu je všeobecný návod na stratifikáciu a zasadiť semienka Tayberry:
<hr/>

Umyte Tayberry semená v studenej tečúcou vodou a vložte ich do nasiaknutého papierového uteráka, utesnenie papierový uterák v taške sendvič a nechať ju v chladničke 3 na 4 týždňov.
<hr/>
Dig a 0.5 inch deep hole in a 14-inch diameter pot filled with potting soil.<br/>
Vykopať 0.5 palec hlboká diera v 14-palcový priemer hrnca naplnené zalievanie pôdy.
<hr/>
Sow 2 or 3 stratified seeds to the hole.<br/>
Zasiať 2 alebo 3 stratifikovanom semená do otvoru.
<hr/>
Cover the hole with the soil you dug up and water immediately with 1/2 cup of water.<br/>
Zakryte otvor s pôdou ste vykopal a voda okamžite 1/2 šálku vody.
<hr/>
Place the pot on a window sill where sunlight will reach the plant; keeps the temperature 70-80 degree Fahrenheit.<br/>
Umiestnite hrniec na okenný parapet, kde slnečné svetlo dosiahne závod; udržuje teplotu 70-80 stupeň Fahrenheita.
<hr/>
Continue watering the plant every day with 1/2 cup water.<br/>
Pokračovať zalievanie rastlín každý deň 1/2 šálky vody.
<hr/>
You should start to see the seedling sprout within 4 weeks.<br/>
Mali by ste začať vidieť sadenice sadba rámci 4 týždňov.
<hr/>
Mix a 2-inch layer of organic material into the soil bed of where you’ll be transplanting the seedling outside.<br/>
Zmiešajte 2-palcový vrstvu organického materiálu do pôdneho lôžka, kde budete presádzanie sadenice vonku.
<hr/>
The organic material can consist of dead leaves, grass clippings and manure.<br/>
Organický materiál sa môže skladať z lístia, pokosená tráva a hnoj.
<hr/>
Apply at least 4 cups of nitrogen fertilizer to ever 100 square feet of soil during late fall.<br/>
Naneste najmenej 4 šálky dusíkatých hnojív do kedy 100 štvorcových stôp pôdy počas neskorej jesene.
<hr/>
The fertilizer will help to break down the organic material in the soil.<br/>
Hnojivo pomôže prelomiť organický materiál v pôde.

Ako zasadiť a pestovať zo semien Cranberries
<hr/>
How to Plant and Grow Cranberries from Seeds<br/>
Ako zasadiť a pestovať zo semien Cranberries
<hr/>
Cranberry plants (Vaccinium macrocarpon) are low-growing, berry-producing vine-like shrubs that are native to regions in eastern North America.<br/>
Cranberry rastliny (Vaccinium macrocarpon) sú nízke rastúce, berry produkujúce víno-ako kríky, ktoré sú pôvodom z oblastí vo východnej Severnej Ameriky.
<hr/>
They are usually grown in sandy, acid-rich soil with bog-like growing conditions.<br/>
Oni sú zvyčajne pestuje v piesčitých, kyseliny bohaté pôdy s bog-ako rastových podmienok.
<hr/>
Growing cranberries from seed requires perseverance and commitment, since the seeds can require a long period of time before germinating.<br/>
Pestovanie zo semien brusníc vyžaduje vytrvalosť a odhodlanie, pretože semená môžu vyžadovať dlhú dobu, než klíčiace.
<hr/>
Step 1: Fill 3- or 4-inch wide pots with enough lime-free sterilized growing medium to fill the pots to within about 1/4 of an inch from the top of the rim.<br/>
Krok 1: Vyplniť 3- alebo 4-palcový širokouhlý hrnca s dostatkom nevápněného sterilným rastovom substráte vyplniť hrnca s presnosťou na 1/4 z palca od hornej hrany.
<hr/>
Step 2: Firm down the soil in each of the planting pots using your fingers, a piece of wood or a metal spoon.<br/>
Krok 2: Firma sa v pôde v každom z výsadby hrnca pomocou prstov, kus dreva alebo kovu lyžice.
<hr/>
Transfer all the pots into an irrigation or watering tray.<br/>
Preneste všetky hrnce do zavlažovanie a zalievanie zásobníka.
<hr/>
The tray should be able to hold about 2 inches of water.<br/>
Zásobník by mal byť schopný držať o 2 centimetrov vody.
<hr/>
Step 3: Pour enough water into the tray so the growing medium in the pots will soak up the water and become well-moistened.<br/>
Krok 3: Nalejte dostatok vody do zásobníka tak, aby pestovateľský substrát v kvetináčoch nasaje vodu a stávajú sa dobre navlhčené.
<hr/>
Pack the soil down one final time.<br/>
Zabaľte pôdy o jeden čas finále.
<hr/>
Pour out the remainder of the water, if there is any.<br/>
Vylejte zvyšok vody, v prípade, že je niektorý.
<hr/>
Step 4: Poke two to three 1/4-inch-deep holes in each pot.<br/>
Krok 4: Poke dva až tri 1/4-inch-deep otvory v každom hrnci.
<hr/>
Drop two cranberry seeds into each of the holes.<br/>
Drop dve brusnicovej semená do všetkých otvorov.
<hr/>
Sprinkle over the top of each pair of seeds approximately 1/4 inch of the growing media.<br/>
Posypeme cez vrchol každého páru semien približne 1/4 palec z rastových.
<hr/>
Step 5: Place the tray of pots in a location in your home that will stay consistently around 65 to 70 degrees F for four weeks.<br/>
Krok 5: Umiestnite zásobník hrncov na miesto vo vašej domácnosti, ktorá zostane natrvalo v okolí 65 na 70 stupňov C po dobu štyroch týždňov.
<hr/>
Provide as much bright light as possible but, if possible, not direct sunlight.<br/>
Poskytnúť čo najviac jasnom svetle, ale ako je to možné, ak je to možné, nie priame slnečné svetlo.
<hr/>
Keep the growing medium moist in each of the pots; add water to the tray as needed.<br/>
Udržujte rastúce stredne vlhké v každom z hrncov; pridať vodu do zásobníka podľa potreby.
<hr/>
Step 6: Transfer the tray of pots into a location where the temperature will be between 25 and 40 degrees F for six weeks.<br/>
Krok 6: Preneste zásobník hrncov na mieste, kde je teplota sa bude pohybovať medzi 25 a 40 stupňov C po dobu šiestich týždňov.
<hr/>
Maintain the moisture levels by adding water to the tray when required.<br/>
Udržiavať úroveň vlhkosti pridaním vody do zásobníka v prípade potreby.
<hr/>
The temperature change is beneficial to hasten germination.<br/>
Zmena teploty je výhodné pre urýchlenie klíčenia.
<hr/>
Step 7: Put the tray of pots into an area where the temperature will stay fairly consistent between 40 and 55 degrees F. Leave the tray of pots in this location for germinating the cranberry seeds.<br/>
Krok 7: Vložte zásobník hrncov do oblasti, kde je teplota zostane pomerne konzistentné medzi 40 a 55 ° F. Nechajte zásobník hrncov v tomto mieste pre klíčenie semien brusníc.
<hr/>
Germination of cranberry seeds can begin in as little as three weeks, or can take several months.<br/>
Klíčenie semien brusníc môže začať už za tri týždne, alebo môže trvať aj niekoľko mesiacov.
<hr/>
Transplant the cranberry seedlings into their permanent location outside after they’ve become well-established.<br/>
Transplantovať brusnicovou sadenice na svoje trvalé umiestnenie mimo po tom, čo som sa dobre zavedená.
