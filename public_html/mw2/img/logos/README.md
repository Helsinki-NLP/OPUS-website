Logos
=====

Multilingwis will use this folder to fetch logos from if configured to do so in the `config.json` file.

You may also use deep link any image in the internet. Keep in mind, that downgrading the protocol (using http for the image while the multilingwis instance is running on https) will evoke security warnings in most browsers.
