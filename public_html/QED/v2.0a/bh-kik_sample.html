<hr>
(src)="11"> Of course not because u can 't even handle such a complicated task as mopping the floor ! <br>
(trg)="10"> The words which he sang were very deep <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> You are nothing more than just uneducated , unpractical and useless losers ! <br>

(trg)="17"> I have never heard someone like he . <br>
(trg)="18"> Obviously Rahim is very good too ... <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> We 'll see if we defeat them by our epic weapons or french will die to laugh seeing us naked , without armors . <br>
