(src)="12"> I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women six months ago . <br>
(trg)="15"> Na nak " embajadora " na ONU Mujeres , xhop bé lin kue , <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> And the more I 've spoken about feminism , the more I have realized that fighting for women 's rights has too often become synonymous with man- hating . <br>
(trg)="16"> Cé dedizh na kuan nak " feminismo " , nen ke kan dien re miy na xhen xha kuan nak ka . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> If there is one thing I know for certain , it is that this has to stop . <br>
(trg)="17"> Nen , ke na kue luzh ah . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> For the record , Feminism , by definition , is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities . <br>
(trg)="18"> Feminismo nak rop na , mgotn ner mi nak na " igual " nakin tak lin reta . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> It is the theory of the political , economic , and social equality of the sexes . <br>

<hr>
(src)="17"> I started questioning gender based assumptions a long time ago . <br>

(src)="18"> When I was eight , I was confused about being called " bossy " because I wanted to direct the plays that we would put on for our parents . <br>

<hr>
(src)="20"> When , at 14 , I started to be sexualized by certain elements of the media . <br>
(trg)="24"> Cé gun 14 lit , re xha ke ko kub kap nien . <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> When , at 15 , my girlfriends started dropping out of their beloved sports teams because they didn 't want to appear muscly . <br>

(src)="22"> When , at 18 , my male friends were unable to express their feelings ... <br>
(trg)="27"> Cé gun 18 , re ta 'an mbí na xhon ta xha ... <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> I decided that I was a feminist . <br>
(trg)="28"> Xha men ke ná de´ yu chan mgol <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> And this seemed uncomplicated to me . <br>
(trg)="29"> Xá ne´ niy <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word . <br>
(trg)="30"> Será dekuan ná ner mnen ke ko de lin na dó last re men na´ <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> Women are choosing not to identify as feminists . <br>
(trg)="31"> Re got na last ta xha gak xha " feministas " <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> Apparently , I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong , too aggressive , isolating , and anti- men . <br>
(src)="28"> Unattractive , even . <br>
(trg)="32"> Nal , reés nien na kap , na nak dib mgol mbí ré mbí na do last ko na <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one ? <br>
(trg)="33"> ¿ Po´ ne ke xhian xha ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> I am from Britain , and I think it is right that I am paid the same as my male counterparts . <br>
(trg)="34"> Na nak " Británica " <br>

(src)="32"> - I think -- - ( raucous applause ) <br>
(trg)="37"> Na lash ... ( men de tes ya 'an ) <br>

(src)="34"> I think it is right that , socially , I am afforded the same respect as men . <br>
(trg)="40"> Na lash güis re no tes xha güis lo re mbí <br>

(src)="35"> But sadly , I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights . <br>
(trg)="41"> Nal , mnén na xhon ni did yes isluo ko de li kue <br>
(trg)="42"> Yent yes ko güi chan re mgot <br>

(src)="36"> No country in the world can yet say that they have achieved gender equality . <br>
(trg)="43"> Yent ni dib yes ko de lí ke re got ner re mbí guen xho <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> These rights ... I consider to be human rights , but I am one of the lucky ones . <br>
(trg)="44"> Nakin kue nak par re ta nó , mgot ner mbí <br>
(trg)="45"> Na , besta xhon <br>

(src)="38"> My life is a sheer privilege because my parents didn 't love me less <br>

(src)="39"> - because I was born a daughter . <br>

<hr>
(src)="41"> My school did not limit me because I was a girl . <br>

(src)="42"> My mentors didn 't assume that I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day . <br>
(trg)="49"> Yent cho mne ke na xhien ná <br>

<hr>
(src)="43"> These influences , with the Gender Equality Ambassadors that made me who I am today ... they may not know it , but they are the inadvertent feminists who are changing the world today . <br>
(trg)="51"> Re ko bezh re men re blí ko nak na nal <br>

(src)="44"> We need more of those . <br>

<hr>
(src)="45"> And if you still hate the word , it is not the word that is important . <br>
(src)="46"> It 's the idea and the ambition behind it . <br>
(trg)="54"> This na lo lats xha mub xhab dis re ko tak nak kuan liy <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> Because not all women have received the same rights that I have . <br>
(trg)="55"> Re ta mgot na genún re kue <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> In fact , statistically , very few have been . <br>
(trg)="56"> Lut xha tak liy <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> In 1997 , Hillary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women 's rights . <br>
(trg)="57"> Hillary Clinton dedizh li 199 let Beijing <br>
(trg)="58"> Niet kuan tak li re mgot <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Sadly , many of the things that she wanted to change are still true today . <br>
(trg)="59"> Nal , lut ko shab xha na de yak tiy nal <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> But what stood out for me the most was that less than 30 % of the audience were male . <br>
(trg)="60"> Ko güin nak ke <br>
(trg)="61"> lut mbí gua ( 30 % ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> How can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited , or feel welcomed to participate in the conversation ? <br>
(src)="53"> Men ... <br>
(trg)="62"> Xha mud lash na xét isluo this na dunt re ta ná nakin kues na re men na kin kues na re mbí <br>

<hr>
(src)="56"> Gender equality is your issue too . <br>
(trg)="64"> Nú gó nakin li goy <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> Because , to date , I 've seen my father 's role as a parent being valued less by society , despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother 's . <br>
(trg)="65"> Nal mnen ke ko li xhun ná na tag tiy <br>

(trg)="67"> Niet re miu diak yis yek re miu sieb nies xha nag xha " mbí " <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> In fact , in the UK , suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20- 49 , eclipsing road accidents , cancer , and coronary heart disease . <br>
(trg)="68"> Inglaterra ka dosh men gudt <br>
(trg)="69"> le ka xha gudxha , re mbí xho 20 ó 49 lit <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> I 've seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success . <br>
(trg)="70"> Nien re mbí sieb sieb xha na niet xha nie mbí <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> Men don 't have the benefits of equality either . <br>
(trg)="71"> Re mbí na li xhin na lit ta gak men <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> We don 't often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes , but I can see that they are , and that when they are free , things will change for women as a natural consequence . <br>
(trg)="72"> Na dedizh ta re men yac na nali mtía thus <br>
(trg)="73"> Xé cé kue , re got xha yú xha yak ah <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> If men don 't have to be aggressive in order to be accepted , women won 't feel compelled to be submissive . <br>
(src)="65"> If men don 't have to control , women won 't have to be controlled . <br>
(src)="66"> Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive . <br>

(src)="68"> It is time that we all perceived gender on a spectrum , instead of two sets of opposing ideals . <br>
(trg)="75"> Nakin güin nalit ta nak ná nadta xhata ( men teés yan ) <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> ( applause ) ( Ms. Watson ) If we stop defining each other by what we are not , and start defining ourselves by who we are , we can all be freer . <br>
(src)="70"> And this is what He for She is about . <br>
(trg)="76"> This laan kue thes day nakin mteten yut nalí kue nak ¨ko le mbí lo mgot " <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> It 's about freedom . <br>

(src)="89"> I hope that those words will be helpful because ... the reality is that if we do nothing , it will take 75 years , or for me to be nearly 100 , before women can expect to be paid the same as men . <br>
(src)="90"> For the same work . <br>
