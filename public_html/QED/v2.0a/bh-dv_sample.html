(src)="1"> Our main armory is exacly on the Giuseppe avenue <br>
(trg)="1"> ... then fegelein rolled natural 20 . <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> Currently , it is being occupied by those Frech homos so we have to get it back coming from the West . <br>
(trg)="2"> It was a critical hit enchanced with several level 1 spells . <br>
(trg)="3"> Pretty good for a low level bard , huh ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> Ya , ya whatever ... any questions ? <br>
(trg)="4"> Yeah , nice . <br>
(trg)="5"> What should I do next ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> Just only one notice ... <br>
(trg)="6"> Boss ... <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> It is the only one armory we have actually , so we don 't have any weapons on this action . <br>
(trg)="7"> You can 't do anything . <br>
(trg)="8"> Fegelein has already won this duel . <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> Anyone who isn 't responsible for our military resources , leave the room . <br>
(trg)="9"> Everyone who isn 't taking part in the tournament , leave the room . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Why aren 't we ready for the situations like this ? ! <br>
(trg)="10"> How is it even possible ? ! <br>
(trg)="11"> Level 3 gnome bard ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> What do I pay you for , dumbasses ? <br>
(trg)="12"> I 'm level 8 half- orc barbarian ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> You can 't even be responsible for arming our forces correctly ! <br>
(src)="10"> Should I make you all my personal maids ? ! <br>
(trg)="13"> I picked the best feats , bought the most expensive sword in game and even multiclassed into sorcerer ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> Of course not because u can 't even handle such a complicated task as mopping the floor ! <br>
(trg)="14"> I stacked so many potions for this fight ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> You are nothing more than just uneducated , unpractical and useless losers ! <br>
(trg)="15"> I 'm sure he was cheating ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> My FÃ¼hrer , I have been studying houseworks for 5 years ! <br>
(trg)="16"> We have done everything to prevent cheating <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> And you were giving bribes and a$ses for the exam results ! <br>
(trg)="17"> Your methods never work ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> But I passed , only that is important ! <br>
(trg)="18"> We caught Krebs using invincibility cheat last week <br>

(src)="16"> Don 't talk to me when I 'm raging , small boy ! <br>
(trg)="19"> It was impossible not to spot ! <br>
(trg)="20"> Jodl couldn 't even touch him ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> How our boys are supposed to win this battle without equipment ? <br>
(trg)="21"> Fegelein probably enchanted his armor with cheats ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> You think they will rush to the armory as a mass with bread as swords and eggs on spoons as bows ? <br>
(trg)="22"> We should ban him from our tournament ! <br>
(trg)="23"> There is no way anyone could beat him ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> We 'll see if we defeat them by our epic weapons or french will die to laugh seeing us naked , without armors . <br>
(trg)="24"> With my stats , I should have beat him with just one hit , but no ! <br>
(trg)="25"> He reflected it like it was a flyswatter , not a hude sword ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> Imagine how 'd other countries react on such an act of desperation . <br>
(trg)="26"> And then this critical hit ! <br>
(trg)="27"> I swear I saw him rolling natural 20 five times in a row when he was fighting Goebbels ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> I 'd lose my authority of cruel and serious dictator and I love that title . <br>
(trg)="28"> I can 't let this man become the bunker champion again . <br>
(trg)="29"> I can 't believe you guys , <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> If that happenned I would throw you all to my special bathroom and then run over you by wagon full of jews by myself . <br>
(trg)="30"> How can you allow him to fool you like that ? <br>
