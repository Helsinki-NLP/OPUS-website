(src)="1"> We need to decide which way to travel to our winter holiday resort <br>
(trg)="1"> My F端hrer , we have got some very , very bad news . <br>
<hr>
(src)="2"> There are several different roads we can take to get there , but this one has the most McDonalds on it <br>
(trg)="2"> We don 't know where we are , this map is useless and what is worse - we haven 't got any other device that could find our location . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> What the hell are you talking about ? <br>
(src)="4"> I failed maths this semester , I 'm not going . <br>
(trg)="3"> But I gave you my Galaxy Note and I begged you to install correctly a cracked Google Maps just in case . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> But chief ..... <br>
(trg)="4"> My F端hrer ... <br>
(trg)="5"> But ... <br>
(trg)="6"> Um ... <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> We have packed the booze and smokes ..... <br>
(trg)="7"> We destroyed your phone because we hate Android phones ... <br>
(trg)="8"> Just ... <br>
(trg)="9"> Google Maps sucks , Apple and its maps rules . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Everyone who has covered up for me in maths class leave the room <br>
(trg)="10"> Anyone here that didn 't destroy my phone , leave the room . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> Damn it ! <br>
(trg)="11"> How dare you talk to me like that ? ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> You should have tried harder ! <br>
(trg)="12"> I lost my lovely Samsung ! <br>
(trg)="13"> Now you are screwed ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> I' ve been waiting for this holiday and that damned teacher ruined it <br>
(trg)="14"> That was our last hope to find Rossmann ! <br>
(trg)="15"> How could you destroy my Samsung ? <br>
(trg)="16"> This is unbelievable ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> When mom and dad find out Santa Clause won 't even come <br>
(trg)="17"> And what 's the most surprising news - you prefer Apple iPhone 5 ! <br>
(trg)="18"> This $hit ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> I was to get a new bike and a games console <br>
(trg)="19"> This is the defeat of the century ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> Not to mention Hanka Mostowiak action figure I wanted so much <br>
(trg)="20"> Small screen , lots of bugs ... ... problems with broken lock button , camera has got an " Purple Halo " issue ... <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> Chief , we will find you a good tutor , you will retake it <br>
(trg)="21"> My F端hrer , but iPhone 5 has an additional row of icons . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> You moron ! <br>
(trg)="22"> Shut up ! <br>
(trg)="23"> And this maps ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> Study on holiday ?? <br>
(src)="17"> Me ?? <br>
(src)="18"> You 're nuts <br>
(trg)="24"> How can we find Rossmann with this horrible iOS maps , huh ? ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> Chief , there 's no other way <br>
(trg)="25"> My F端hrer , please give us a chance ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> There 's no way that woman is going to make me study <br>
(trg)="26"> NO ! <br>
(trg)="27"> Without Google Maps we can 't do ANYTHING ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> I was to play Angry Birds for two damn weeks <br>
(trg)="28"> Please tell me , how do we deal with this bugged map ? ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> She has some spirit to have failed me <br>
(trg)="29"> We won 't be able to find this damn shop ! <br>
(trg)="30"> NEVER ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> I 'm gonna make her really sorry for that i" m gonna poison her cat , stalk her on the net . <br>
(trg)="31"> And what also drives me crazy in Apple is this nonsensical battle with Samsung ! <br>
(trg)="32"> Apple just want to patent a rectangle with rounded corners . <br>
(trg)="33"> And what else ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> She is going to regret that for the rest of her life <br>
(trg)="34"> Black color of the phone ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> Such beautiful plans , everything ruined , all the booze and smokes wasted ..... having a few laughs with the boys <br>
(trg)="35"> I don 't think so that even the most stupid person can mistake iPhone with one of the Galaxy phone , goddammit ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> I can 't believe she made me so angry . <br>
(src)="27"> And you idiots are useless . <br>
(trg)="36"> Oh My God , I 'm so angry that I don 't know what else I can say ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> Why should I keep you in my gang , you dumb idiots ? <br>
(trg)="37"> I need my hair conditioner immediately ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> You can 't even think of a good cover up . <br>
(trg)="38"> This is the most important thing for me ! <br>
(trg)="39"> As same as new phone ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> I just can 't understand why any of you should be here . <br>
(trg)="40"> I 'm disappointed ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> Go kill yourselves , will you ? <br>
(trg)="41"> Very , very disappointed ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> No harm will be done , and at least I won 't have to look at your stupid faces and listen to your " but chief ... " <br>
(trg)="42"> You used to be my best friends and now ? <br>
(trg)="43"> I don 't wanna see you anymore ! <br>
(trg)="44"> There will be blood , I promise . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Don 't worry . <br>
(trg)="45"> Don 't worry . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> We 've made three cheat sheets for him <br>
(trg)="46"> We will try to fix it . <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> Don 't bother to say you are sorry . <br>
(trg)="47"> I can 't handle this ... <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> I wanted to study . <br>
(trg)="48"> That was a gift to me from me ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> Go to university . <br>
(src)="38"> Be someone . <br>
(src)="39"> But who cares about me ? <br>
(trg)="50"> I will buy those things ... ... from your pay . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> Well , I shouldn 't lose all hope . <br>
(trg)="51"> And I don 't wanna hear any opposition from you , morons . <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> We can think of a way to get me out of this mess . <br>
(trg)="52"> An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> So I suggest you roll up your sleeves , boys . <br>
