(trg)="29"> We won 't be able to find this damn shop ! <br>
(trg)="30"> NEVER ! <br>
(trg)="31"> And what also drives me crazy in Apple is this nonsensical battle with Samsung ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> We 'll see if we defeat them by our epic weapons or french will die to laugh seeing us naked , without armors . <br>
