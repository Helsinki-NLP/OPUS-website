(src)="2"> I did . <br>
(trg)="2"> " We are millionaires now . " - ... Maybe . <br>
<hr>
(src)="3"> When I retired , <br>
(trg)="3"> - Ok . <br>
<hr>
(src)="4"> It was time to come to terms with myself . <br>
(trg)="4"> Let 's give it a try . <br>
<hr>
(src)="5"> I had to get rid of all these clients . <br>
(trg)="5"> See him ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="6"> The tears . <br>
(trg)="6"> - A typical policeman . <br>
<hr>
(src)="7"> Inside these folders . <br>
(trg)="7"> - Yes . <br>
<hr>
(src)="8"> It moved me . <br>
(trg)="8"> - But how long has he been gone ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="9"> I went too far . <br>
(trg)="9"> - He is a bit too young . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> Oslo Private Investigation Agency . <br>
(trg)="10"> - He is young . <br>
<hr>
(src)="11"> - I am a problem solver . <br>
(trg)="11"> - I am a problem solver . <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> And I have solved thousands of cases . <br>
(trg)="12"> - I 'm so emotional that I - <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> But now it 's about time I address my own life . <br>
(trg)="13"> - Oh , I see . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> I had to be an actor my whole life . <br>
(trg)="14"> - You can see it there , there , there . <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> Through my work , I have had hundreds of roles . <br>
(trg)="15"> - Ok . <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> So the best way to tell about it is to act it out . <br>
(trg)="16"> So he 's a bit hard to grasp ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> - Hello , hello , - Hi . <br>
(trg)="17"> - Yes . <br>
<hr>
(src)="18"> - Fun to meet you . <br>
(trg)="18"> - Okay - Policeman . <br>
<hr>
(src)="19"> - Yes , very nice . <br>
(trg)="19"> - So he 's hiding something ? - it hurts . <br>
<hr>
(src)="20"> My name is Tuva . <br>
(trg)="20"> - " He has been away for a while , and I 'm worried . " <br>
<hr>
(src)="21"> This is tremendous . <br>
(trg)="21"> - A little made- up story . <br>
<hr>
(src)="22"> Very nice . <br>
(trg)="22"> - You would have made- up a situation . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> - Here is your office . <br>
(trg)="23"> - But could this have been your office ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> - Yes . <br>
(trg)="24"> - Fun to meet you . <br>
<hr>
(src)="25"> - What a fantastic job . <br>
(trg)="25"> - Yes , very nice . <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> It is very strange . <br>
(trg)="26"> My name is Tuva . <br>
<hr>
(src)="27"> I can 't say it 's painful . <br>
(trg)="27"> - Hello , hello , - Hi . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> But it 's completely fantastic . <br>
(trg)="28"> - Here is your office . <br>
<hr>
(src)="29"> - But could this have been your office ? <br>
(trg)="29"> - Yes . <br>
<hr>
(src)="30"> - Oh , absolutely . <br>
(trg)="30"> - In everything ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="31"> I almost want to go back . <br>
(trg)="31"> - In everything . <br>
<hr>
(src)="32"> It 's like I am going backwards into the past . <br>
(trg)="32"> - Oh , absolutely . <br>
<hr>
(src)="33"> Oslo Private Investigation Agency . <br>
(trg)="33"> - What a fantastic job . - and you were the only person who could deal with it . - how long are you allowed to follow a person ? - it has come back in its entirety . <br>
<hr>
(src)="34"> I 'm calling because I am a bit worried about my husband . <br>
(trg)="34"> From the very beginning . - it would have to be someone complex . - takes a lot of love from both sides to manage . - who could go from being very kind to being very dangerous - <br>
<hr>
(src)="35"> There were all types of people . <br>
(trg)="35"> - word had gone around town that I was good at it . ... I had to simply pull her up by the bootstraps . ... think a bit . <br>
<hr>
(src)="36"> People who needed help with something they could not solve themselves . <br>
(trg)="36"> A couple of years ago I met a lady who came and put her arms around me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="37"> - But how long has he been gone ? <br>
(trg)="37"> A lady comes to visit him . <br>
<hr>
(src)="38"> Just a day or ... ? <br>
(trg)="38"> A total goner . <br>
<hr>
(src)="39"> - " He has been away for a while , and I 'm worried . " <br>
(trg)="39"> After that sort of thing . <br>
<hr>
(src)="40"> There were business thefts . <br>
(trg)="40"> Always someone on the phone or at home or whatever , right ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="41"> There was fraud . <br>
(trg)="41"> Always someone taking up space . <br>
<hr>
(src)="42"> There were incredibly many things . <br>
(trg)="42"> And I didn 't have the sense to let go . <br>
<hr>
(src)="43"> And after a while - <br>
(trg)="43"> And I have solved thousands of cases . <br>
<hr>
(src)="44"> - word had gone around town that I was good at it . <br>
(trg)="44"> And I often said to the client , I 'm here for you . <br>
<hr>
(src)="45"> Because it was what I lived for , eventually . <br>
(trg)="45"> And I stayed at home and worked far too much . <br>
<hr>
(src)="46"> I understand . <br>
(trg)="46"> And I think she has had a bad conscience regarding me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="47"> Just talk to us and then we can find out if ... <br>
(trg)="47"> And I was not the easiest person to work with . <br>
<hr>
(src)="48"> You have no information . <br>
(trg)="48"> And cut . <br>
<hr>
(src)="49"> I need to talk to someone . <br>
(trg)="49"> And followed him all the way in ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="50"> Some people were almost out of their minds . <br>
(trg)="50"> And he was away from work then too . <br>
<hr>
(src)="51"> Some came and said , " Have I gone mad ? " <br>
(trg)="51"> And if someone was going to play Gunnar , his personality - <br>
<hr>
(src)="52"> " I can 't think about anything else . " <br>
(trg)="52"> And it did not go so well <br>
<hr>
(src)="53"> They had to know . <br>
(trg)="53"> And it sounded terribly exciting . <br>
<hr>
(src)="54"> You can tell if someone is lying . <br>
(trg)="54"> And just be myself . <br>
<hr>
(src)="55"> You can feel it . <br>
(trg)="55"> And little focus on herself . <br>
<hr>
(src)="56"> It was often painful for me to break news to my clients . <br>
(trg)="56"> And nor was my husband . <br>
<hr>
(src)="57"> But you could see them blossom up . <br>
(trg)="57"> And often when men feel inadequate , there can be trouble . <br>
<hr>
(src)="58"> Decisiveness , kind of . <br>
(trg)="58"> And on the inside , not crying - screaming . <br>
<hr>
(src)="59"> When they finally found out , they could make their own decisions . <br>
(trg)="59"> And perhaps it affected you . <br>
<hr>
(src)="60"> They changed . <br>
(trg)="60"> I do not know . <br>
<hr>
(src)="61"> They became themselves . <br>
(trg)="61"> And she didn 't come through the attic . <br>
<hr>
(src)="62"> They were not crazy . <br>
(trg)="62"> And that 's where I met Gunnar . <br>
<hr>
(src)="63"> I recognized myself in my clients´ fates . <br>
(trg)="63"> And the eyes . <br>
<hr>
(src)="64"> There are parallels between my clients´ fates and my own life . <br>
(trg)="64"> I was never quite sure . <br>
<hr>
(src)="65"> I was married to my first husband for 10 years . <br>
(trg)="65"> And then I thought , " Oh , now I am free . <br>
<hr>
(src)="66"> I lived in Haslum , outside Oslo . <br>
(trg)="66"> Now I am really free . " <br>
<hr>
(src)="67"> There was beer Saturdays and weekly magazines on Wednesdays . <br>
(trg)="67"> And then I took the boat " Bergen 's Fjord " home . <br>
<hr>
(src)="68"> I was drowning . <br>
(trg)="68"> And then he just came and got me . <br>
<hr>
(src)="69"> I had had enough . <br>
(trg)="69"> And then it could take a long time . <br>
<hr>
(src)="70"> I just wanted to escape from everything . <br>
(trg)="70"> And took up space . <br>
<hr>
(src)="71"> I wanted more . <br>
(trg)="71"> Took up time . <br>
<hr>
(src)="72"> I had relatives in America , so I travelled there to get away . <br>
(trg)="72"> And we tailed you . <br>
<hr>
(src)="73"> To get wind under my wings . <br>
(trg)="73"> And you are locked up in the bedroom ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="74"> And then I took the boat " Bergen 's Fjord " home . <br>
(trg)="74"> And you let that happen ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="75"> And that 's where I met Gunnar . <br>
(trg)="75"> Are you sure about that ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="76"> I became very , very fond of him . <br>
(trg)="76"> As a child , I was taught . <br>
<hr>
(src)="77"> But he was married and I was married . <br>
(trg)="77"> If the phone rings , be quiet . <br>
<hr>
(src)="78"> So nothing more came of it . <br>
(trg)="78"> Asked if anyone recently moved in or was expected to arrive . <br>
<hr>
(src)="79"> So when I came home I returned to my husband , <br>
(trg)="79"> At our home . <br>
<hr>
(src)="80"> Because I promised him that I would . <br>
(trg)="80"> At that time , he was involved in stock market speculation . <br>
<hr>
(src)="81"> But after a while , I had just had to get away again . <br>
(trg)="81"> Back at it , the next night . <br>
<hr>
(src)="82"> I couldn 't handle it anymore . <br>
(trg)="82"> Because I promised him that I would . <br>
<hr>
(src)="83"> That part of my life was over . <br>
(trg)="83"> Because clients could be calling . <br>
<hr>
(src)="84"> And then I thought , " Oh , now I am free . <br>
(trg)="84"> Because if one is not like that , one should not be an investigator . <br>
<hr>
(src)="85"> Now I am really free . " <br>
(trg)="85"> Because it was what I lived for , eventually . <br>
<hr>
(src)="86"> My sister who lived in Stockholm , said " Come over . " <br>
(trg)="86"> Because you could see everything at once . <br>
<hr>
(src)="87"> I arrived in Sweden and got a job as a dentist assistant . <br>
(trg)="87"> Because you have to escape ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="88"> I worked there for almost a year . <br>
(trg)="88"> Both physically and mentally . <br>
<hr>
(src)="89"> And then he just came and got me . <br>
(trg)="89"> But I won 't break down . <br>
<hr>
(src)="90"> With a van and everything . <br>
(trg)="90"> I won 't . <br>
<hr>
(src)="91"> I didn 't know him at all . <br>
(trg)="91"> I can take it . <br>
<hr>
(src)="92"> Yes , I was crazy in love . <br>
(trg)="92"> But after a while , I had just had to get away again . <br>
<hr>
(src)="93"> A total goner . <br>
(trg)="93"> But along with the cases came the pain , always . <br>
<hr>
(src)="94"> How did I become a private investigator ? <br>
(trg)="94"> But describing him to an outsider , how would you have done it . <br>
<hr>
(src)="95"> I didn 't really have a choice . <br>
(trg)="95"> But does he look stern ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="96"> When I arrived in Oslo , Gunnar was very excited about it . <br>
(trg)="96"> Or does he look kind ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="97"> I wanted adventure , so I went along with everything . <br>
(trg)="97"> But does this not seem peculiar ? <br>
<hr>
(src)="98"> And it sounded terribly exciting . <br>
(trg)="98"> But he was married and I was married . <br>
<hr>
(src)="99"> I cannot seem to talk about myself without talking about Gunnar . <br>
(trg)="99"> But if he had come out here and you continued to follow him - <br>
