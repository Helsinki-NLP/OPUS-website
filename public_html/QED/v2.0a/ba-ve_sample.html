(src)="2"> I 'm Amber Wild , and I am a BYU- Idaho Pathway student . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt; I had known that I wanted to go back to school for&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt; awhile , was at Rhode Island College , but then I&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt; stopped to serve my mission . <br>
(trg)="1"> OK , now that youve mastered decimals , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you now get the next hurdle, which is fractions . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now , when we do fractions , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; the same principles that appliedwith decimals apply with fractions . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So lets review what some of those were , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; specifically when we wereadding decimals . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; We did stuff like &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 238 . 51 plus 4 . 29 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now youve done enough of theseproblems , youre like, Uhh , thats not gonna work .  &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Right here the decimals arent lined up, you cant really do that problem , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so you move it over here and you say , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; OK , 238 . 51 plus 4 . 29 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now as you recall , why thatwas so important . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Here we have the tenths column . Here we have the hundredths column . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And , like we learned in the beginning, you cannot&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; take something like five apples&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; plus seven penguins &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and get anything . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; They need to be alike in orderfor adding to occur . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So here we have five- tenths and two- tenths, thats where we get the seven- tenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; One- hundredth plus nine- hundredths , that would be ten , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and thats where we carried the one , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and so then we would carry on like that . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now Im gonna write out that problemjust a little bit differently . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; We had 238&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and five- tenths&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and one- hundredth , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and we added it to four&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and two- tenths&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and nine- hundredths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now what really happened over here, we took one- hundredth&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; plus nine- hundredths was&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; ten- hundredths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And that became zero- hundredthsand one- tenth . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So there was a carrying that happened . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Remember what we did here : five plus two was seven , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and we worried about carrying, but here notice we do&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; five- tenths plus two- tenths , thats&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; seven- tenths , and then we wouldcarry the one from over there . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; But this actually forms a basis ofwhats going on with fractions . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Right here we were able to add thesebecause they were exactly alike . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; They were both tenths . Here theyre exactly the same, being hundredths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And so we are able to leave the realm oftens , hundreds , thousands , millions , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and we can determineany denominator we want . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; We can determine sevenths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; eighths , fifths , fourths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but the same principle applies . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , we can do a problemvery similar to these , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but instead of saying tenths we can say , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; OK , so two and three- sevenths &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; plus five and one- seventh . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Doing this problem , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; we now have the ones column, just like normal , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; tens column , hundreds column , going this way , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but right here, this is not the tenths column, its the sevenths column . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So we have three- seventhsplus one- seventh , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and thats where we get four- sevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And seven . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So were able to do thatthe exact same way we did before . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Trying another one : &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 136 and seven- elevenths &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; plus &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 251 and &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; three- elevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Were gonna do this exactly likewe did with decimals , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; except now , instead of the tenths column, we now have the elevenths column . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So seven- elevenths plusthree- elevenths is &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; ten- elevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Six ones and one one : seven ones . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Three tens and five tens : eight tens . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 100 and 200 : <br>

(trg)="4"> We have two divided by two , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; three divided by three, four divided by four , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; five divided by five, six divided by six , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; eighteen divided by eighteen , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; square root of three divided bythe square root of three , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; pi divided by pi . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; We get any number over itself is one . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And its not that it means one , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but it means that numberthat we call one , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; we call two over two, three over three , four over four&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; theyre all exactly the same thing . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So were gonna do another one here . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Lets try to find new names forsomething like two- thirds . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now as you look at thisyoure like , two- thirds , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; same name as two- thirds , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and you have &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; four- sixths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youll notice what happened isI times by two hereand times by two there . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Well I just times by two and two, thats another name for one . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So I just times this guy by one . That means hes the same thing . Theyre exactly the same thing . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Here we have six- ninths, if you times by three and three . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If you times by four and four, times by five over five . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So were using all thesedifferent names to get all thedifferent names for this guy . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Five over five looks like that . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Six over six . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So lets get some new namesfor this one . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Two- fifths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times by eight over eight . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Thats a new name . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times by eleven over eleven . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times by three over three . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And you may wonder, Where are you getting those numbers ? &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Im just pulling them out of the air . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You can pull out any number : seven . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times on top and the bottom &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and there we have it . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; A new name for two- fifths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You can go and makea whole bunch of these . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Lets do this one . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; New name for three- elevenths, lets just make a couple of them . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times by two over two, we get six over 22 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times by three over three, well get nine over 33 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times by four over four : twelve over 44 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Times by five , we get fifteen over 55 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now if youre able to take theseand transform them into other&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; names and vice versa , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; the whole world of fractions&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; isnt so tough anymore . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Ill show you what I mean . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If you look at this problem, we ran into an issue withtheyre not the same thing . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; However , this hasa whole bunch of names . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; It can have a bottom of ten , fifteen , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 55 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; This could have a whole bunch ofdifferent denominators as well , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and you see some of them listed here . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Notice that that guy andthat guy right there , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; they can add togethertheyre like things . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Here you have 22 fifty- fifths, there you have fifteen fifty- fifths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Its a different name forthe same number . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So this guy 22 fifty- fifthsand fifteen fifty- fifths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Those two add together just fine . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You have 22 of them andfifteen of them would be &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 37 fifty- fifths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So lets write it downhow weve got this . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When youre adding fractions&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; step number one : &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you have to get common denominators . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now most of the time, like in this one , youre like , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Oh five and eleven , what can I turnboth five and eleven into ? &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Five times elevenhuh, fifty- five they both go into it . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So you can do this based on observation . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You can do this based onthose two timesing together . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And then theres another onethat Im gonna show you , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and its called prime factorization . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; This is for the big problems . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; But lets do a couple morethat you can see what thedenominator would be . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Lets take one- half plus one- third . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; OK , one- half has a whole bunchof different names . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; It could be two- fourths , three- sixths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; four- eighths , five- tenths , and so on . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; This guy could be two- sixths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; three- ninths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; four- twelfths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; five- fifteenths , and so on and so forth . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You notice that there are a coupleof themthis name and that name&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; theyll work . <br>
(trg)="5"> Youll be able to do it . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; One- half is the same as three- sixths, one third is the same as two- sixthsand you can take , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Ah , three- sixths and- two sixths, thats five- sixths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Lets do one more down here . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If you have &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; three- eighths plus&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; three- eighths plus one- sixth . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Again , think of all the numbers thateight can go into : &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; eight , sixteen , 24and youre like , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Oh wait ! <br>

(src)="5"> The answers to my&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt; prayers have been , you know , it 's been very evident&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt; that the Lord has been answering them through&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt; this program . <br>
(trg)="7"> Im going to that . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youll notice thats justby observation . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youre like , Hey they both happento go into 24 , thats great . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You could also do it by multiplying . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Lets do it this way first . If were gonna make this a 24 , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; its gotta times by three and by three , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so thats gonna be nine twenty- fourths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Right here were going to timesby four and four . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So we get &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; thirteen twenty- fourths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If we multiplied and wedget forty- eighthsforty- eight as the denominator . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Well thats true , lets look at that . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So another name for this, if we timesed by six and six , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; would be eighteen forty- eighths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And this one , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; times by eight and eight : &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; eight forty- eighths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So if we add those two together , we get &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 26 forty- eighths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; That might bother some of you, that it appears that we gota different answer . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Well , those two are the same number . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And this is part of the process that youre going to do with fractions , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; is make sure you can identifythat those two areexactly the same thing . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youll notice that this guytimesed by two is 26 , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; that guy times by two is 48 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; That means that this one is anew name for that one right there, theyre the exact the same thing . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When you take it and take outall the numbers you can&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so you get the simplest form , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; that is called simplifying . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When you take the simple oneand you make it bigger , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; they dont have a name for that , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so I call it complexifying . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Com- plex- i- fy- ing . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Because youre making it lookmore complex even thoughits really all the same number . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So thats the thing, sometimes when you do the multiplying , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you might have to do some simplifyingat the very end of the problem . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , Im going to show youprime factors right now . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; This one is a little bit tougher , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and usually should be reservedfor the harder problems , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but you need to see it now so thatyoull be able to do stuff later on . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So were gonna get a big one here . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Seven over 72 plus eleven over 96 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If youre anything like me , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I dont happen to know my72 times tables off the top of my head . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I dont know the 96 times tablesoff the top of my head either . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Being able to just say , Oh yeah look, I have a number here that both of thosego into ? <br>
(trg)="8"> Not a chance ! &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I could you know, theres a good number&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; that would work for both of them, and that is whatever 72 times 96 is , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I dont know, its up in the 6000´s somewhere . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Theres probably gonna bea lot of simplifying . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Kind of like on that last problem, we had to simplify once , this isprobably going to give us a lot of them . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So here , prime factors . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I have to tell you , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; prime factorization&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; allows a mathematician to do to a number&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; what a biologist does to uh , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; a worm , or an organism that hes cuttingup and he sees how it works inside , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; thats the microscope . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; What a chemist does to chemical compounds . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Prime factorization is where wesplit the number open and we seewhat its made of . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; We find out its genetic code . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; In this case , 72 , if we factor this &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; what makes 72 ? &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Six times twelve , or eight times nine, either one of them . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And then what makes up the six ? Its a two and a three . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Twelve is a two and a six , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and a two and a three . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So here at the end , we gettwo , two , two , three , three . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I just kind of like to put themin order , so you know, get the smallest ones first , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but this right here is the code for 72 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You break it down into the numbersuntil you cant break it down any moreand these are the&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; these are prime . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Thats what that means, it goes all the way down , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and you cant break a prime number downany further . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , heres its genetic code : two , two , two , three , three . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When we do 96 &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; that is , um eight times twelve . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Thats four times two . <br>

(trg)="11"> And thats the idea . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; The simplified version of a numberis the one everybody uses . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youre attending college right now , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; people probably ask you your agequite often . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Can you imaginewalking around and saying , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Oh yes , Im the square root of 361 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And they would justlook at you very odd . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Its the same as nineteen , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but nobody ever says that . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I mean , they really think yourekind of a geek . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , simplifying a number&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; is just a way to be able to communicate and say , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Ah , we really do have the same number, when everybody&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; on what the simplified version is . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So you take this thing right here , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; now normally we could seeOh ! <br>
(trg)="12"> Hey , look . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I think a two willgo into top and bottom , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; thatll be kind of a nice onebecause theyre both even . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; But this prime factorization, if you can pull out &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; everything that its made of, youll be able to tell exactly&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; how well it canit can be simplified . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , on this one , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , on this one, we would break it down like this&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Ill let you do that144 is , like , twelve , twelve . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And so , this would be the same as &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; twelve &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; times twelve . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So I did twelve and twelve . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And then on the bottom, this is fourteen times fourteen , so &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now what this is , we broke it downas far as we couldwith the prime factorization&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and now its very easy to see : <br>
(trg)="13"> Oh ! &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Heres a two over twothat somebody put on theretake it off . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Heres another two over two . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Take that one off . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And so were left with&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; four times nine is 36 &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; seven times seven is 49 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And what this does is tell you for sure&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; there is nothing elsethat will ever come out of those numbers&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; because we broke it downto its very basic form . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; OK , so minor digression on simplifying, lets come back here, this is how were adding fractions . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Common denominators . Observations gonna be the easiest one, by all means . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youre going to be able to say , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Oh yeah , common denominatorlooks like twelve, or looks like fifteen , or 24 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If youre not able to tell exactly , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you can always multiply the two numbers, and that will get you&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; a number that they both go into . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You may have to do some simplifyingwith this one , and on the big ones&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I think theres only a couple ofproblems on your assignments , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but thisll be one to work together on . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; OK , so get common denominators . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Two now , the denominators , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; theyre the ones on the bottom . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If nobodys ever told you yet&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; why theyre called denominators, you need to know . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When you have a fraction , like &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; three- fifths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Im gonna write it out like this, three- fifths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When you cut up something intofive parts , each one of them is a fifth . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And this is telling you what you have . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Like in currency , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you can have a twenty- markdenomination bill , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; a twenty- dollar denomination , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; ten- dollar denomination , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; two hundred- peso denomination . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Denomination is how you are telling&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; what youre dealing with , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and this is telling how many you have , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so you are enumerating these things . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So that denotes &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; thats why its a denominator, its saying , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Aha , this is a denomination, were talking about fifths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And this is how many there are , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and so that is why thisis called a numerator . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Thats why this one is called a numerator &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and this is a denominator . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , once you have the same denominator , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; that means youre now adding like things . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So when we do it, when we have like things , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; we count up the total ofhow much we have . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So in this case , you add the numerators &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; also known as adding the tops . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And then &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; like we did before , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; if youre gonna carry , you have to carryby what youre talking about . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If its fifths, once you get five of them, you have a whole thing and you carry . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If you have twelfths, you carry with that . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; An easy way to remember this&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; is if youre dealing withdays of the week , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; each day of the week is a seventh . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And so if you talk about&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; how many days make a week, once you get seven- sevenths of a week , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; it carries over and its a whole week . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So youre gonna carry&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; by the denominator . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And then finally &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you have to simplify&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; at the end so everybodyson the same page as to what numberyoure really talking about . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; This is very similar to whatyoure gonna do with subtraction , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so we better do a coupleof subtraction problems to make sureyoure OK with that . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You know in subtraction , we have &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; two- thirds minus one- fourth . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You can do the same thing, weve got to get common denominators&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; addition and subtraction we alwayshave to do like things . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , two- thirds minus one- fourth, can you think about what thecommon denominator might be ? &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Two- thirds minus a fourth . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If you cant , go aheadand write out a few of these : &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; two- thirds , four- sixths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you keep going but youre like, Wait !  Three , six , nine , twelve , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Ah , twelve is what its gonna be . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , on this guy Id have totimes by a four , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; times by a four, so you get eight- twelfths minus &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; minus , in this case, Id have to times by three , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; times by three : three- twelfths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , eight- twelfths minus three- twelfthsbetter be five- twelfths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Good deal . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Lets see if you remembernegative numbers really well . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If you had &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; two- fifths minus seven- eighths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Here weve got to get acommon denominator , very first thing . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You can do it by observation . If you cant think about it, go ahead and multiply the two . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Five times eight : <br>

(trg)="14"> 40 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; That is whatll be a nicecommon denominator , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you gettimes by eight , times by eight&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; sixteen over 40 minustimes by five times by five&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 35 over 40 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Ooh ! <br>
(trg)="15"> Sixteen minus 35, how well do you remember your negatives ? &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youre starting at sixteen andyoure subtracting 35 , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; which means youre gonna go past zero, youre gonna end up down in the negatives , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and thats what happensthis numbers really bigger , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so its strongertheyre tug of warringagainst each other , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you have sixteen fortiethspulling positive , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 35 fortieths pulling negative&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; this guy wins . And so you subtract these two&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 35 minus sixteen&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and the negative guy wins . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So negative nineteen fortieths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So if we do this with subtraction , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; there are a couple thingswe have to add here . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So , youre going to add orsubtract numerators . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Were gonna do a problemwhere were gonna borrow now . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 428 and &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; two- sevenths minus&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; fifteen and &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; four- sevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So we have this age- old debate now . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Were doing the same thingbut just decimals , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; we cantwe dont have a decimal point , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; were now dealing witha sevenths column . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So this could be considereddays of the week . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If this is 428 weeks and two days , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; thats 428 and two- sevenths weeks , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; minus fifteen weeks and four days, thats fifteen and four- sevenths weeks . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; This is the age- old debate : &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; two minus four , can you really geta number from two minus four ? &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; I mean , you take &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; If I have two carrots on the tableand I go and steal four of them , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you think, It doesnt quite make sense . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Thats exactly whats going on , is&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; that we have to takea whole thing right here , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so were down to seven whole weeks . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; How many days does it make ? It makes seven of them . <br>
(trg)="16"> Notice &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; it turns this into nine- sevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youre not going to cancel thisand put a one out here , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; youre not borrowing tenof them at a time , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; youre cashing in a whole thing hereand youre getting out so many sevenths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; you 're getting out seven sevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now youre able to go : nine minus four , thats five- sevenths , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; seven minus five is two, two minus one is one , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; four minus zero is four . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 412 and five- sevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; see if we can do one more of those . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 300 uh , yeah 35&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; eight- elevenths minus &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 149&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and three- elevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now , at first glance, this doesnt look so bad . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youre like , Oh , thats not so bad . Look , eight minus three, thats five- elevenths , good deal . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Five minus nineOK, wed have to borrow from the three &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; But then you start walking out hereand youre like , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; What dotheres nothingto borrow from out here . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When were doing subtraction , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; theres kind of a first step, step zero , up here , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youve got to set it up . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Youve got to get&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; subtract with the big guy on top . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So step zero , youve got to subtract &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; with the biggest on top , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Or the strongest, if you want to [ call it ] . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Were gonna rewrite this . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; You have a negative 149and three- elevenths&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and 35 and eight- elevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now I put the minus sign here, were still going to be subtracting , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; theres still a minus sign here, but just put the biggest one up on top . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Its gonna make life a lot easier for us . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now we can borrow, there 's eight of those and it gives us&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; were talking about elevenths now, not tenths&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so it gives us eleven of them, so we really have fourteen- eleventhsout here now . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Fourteen minus eight : six- elevenths . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Eight minus five is three, four minus three is one, and then you have a one . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now the ideawe just subtracted , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; but this guyin the tug of war between thesetwo numbers , this guy wins &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so the overall answer will be negative . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; And that should take care of addition, subtraction of fractions , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; so remember were carrying&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; or in this case borrowing&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; by the denominator , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and then well simplify . Now weve always got to remember&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; that when youre subtracting, the biggest guy will win . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; So that takes care ofaddition , subtraction of fractions, now we get the easy part . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; We get &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; multiplication and divisionof fractions . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now , were also gonna go back to decimals&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; for how we learn this one . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; When we have something like&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 2, 000&amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; times 40 , &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; and you could actually do this out2, 000 plus 2, 000 plus 2, 000 plus 2, 000and see what you get . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; We ended up with eight and four zeros : &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; 80, 000 . &amp; lt; br / &amp; gt ; Now were going to break that upa little bit . <br>
