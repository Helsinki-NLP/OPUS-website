<hr>
(src)="9"> Everyone who isn 't taking part in the tournament , leave the room . <br>
(trg)="6"> Anyone here who didn 't bought the Kinematografia CD , leave the room . <br>
<hr>
(src)="10"> How is it even possible ? ! <br>
(src)="11"> Level 3 gnome bard ? <br>
(trg)="7"> Why no one tell me this before ? ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="12"> I 'm level 8 half- orc barbarian ! <br>
(trg)="8"> It was my dream to see him ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="13"> I picked the best feats , bought the most expensive sword in game and even multiclassed into sorcerer ! <br>
(trg)="9"> He was the best polish rapper . <br>
<hr>
(src)="14"> I stacked so many potions for this fight ! <br>
(trg)="10"> The words which he sang were very deep <br>
<hr>
(src)="15"> I 'm sure he was cheating ! <br>
(trg)="11"> Now my dreams lay in ruins <br>
<hr>
(src)="16"> We have done everything to prevent cheating <br>
(trg)="12"> But there will be Rahim and Fokus . <br>
<hr>
(src)="17"> Your methods never work ! <br>
(trg)="13"> Why would I care about this if there won 't be my idol ? ! <br>

<hr>
(src)="22"> We should ban him from our tournament ! <br>
(trg)="17"> I have never heard someone like he . <br>
<hr>
(src)="23"> There is no way anyone could beat him ! <br>
(trg)="18"> Obviously Rahim is very good too ... <br>
<hr>
(src)="24"> With my stats , I should have beat him with just one hit , but no ! <br>
(src)="25"> He reflected it like it was a flyswatter , not a hude sword ! <br>
(trg)="19"> But not as good as Magik ! <br>
<hr>
(src)="26"> And then this critical hit ! <br>
(src)="27"> I swear I saw him rolling natural 20 five times in a row when he was fighting Goebbels ! <br>
(trg)="20"> And Fokus can not compete with them both . <br>
<hr>
(src)="28"> I can 't let this man become the bunker champion again . <br>
(src)="29"> I can 't believe you guys , <br>
