I believe in America. America has made my fortune...<br/>
난 미국을 믿소<br/>
<hr/>
and I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I give her freedom,<br/>
딸애도 미국식으로 키웠죠<br/>
<hr/>
but I taught her never to dishonor her family.<br/>
그 애에게 자유를 주면서 가족의 명예를 가르쳤소<br/>
<hr/>
She found a boyfriend. Not an Italian. She went to the movies with him.<br/>
이태리인이 아닌 남자 친구를 만나<br/>
<hr/>
with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey...<br/>
두 달 전 그 애는 두 녀석과 함께 드라이브를 했소<br/>
<hr/>
She resisted.She kept her honor.<br/>
겁탈하려 했소<br/>
<hr/>
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken... her jaw was shattered...<br/>
병원에 가보니 그 애는 코가 부러지고<br/>
<hr/>
held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain.<br/>
턱은 으스러져 철사로 봉합시켜 놓았소<br/>
<hr/>
But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life.<br/>
난 울었소 왜 그랬겠소?<br/>
<hr/>
Beautiful girl.<br/>
아름다웠죠<br/>
<hr/>
Now she will never be beautiful again.<br/>
그런데 이젠 추하게 돼버린 거요<br/>
<hr/>
Sorry.<br/>
미안합니다<br/>
<hr/>
I went to the police like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial.<br/>
난 경찰서에 가서 놈들을 고소했소<br/>
<hr/>
Ajudge sentence them to three years in prison...and suspend their sentence.<br/>
기가 막히게 3년형에<br/>
<hr/>
Suspended sentence. They went free that very day.<br/>
집행유예라니!<br/>
<hr/>
I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastard, they smiled at me.<br/>
난 법정에 멍하게 서있었고<br/>
<hr/>
Then I said to my wife, "For justice we must go to Don Corleone."<br/>
그때 난 돈 꼴레오네 씨께 가야겠다고 결심했죠<br/>
<hr/>
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What do you want of me?<br/>
왜 내게 먼저 안 오고 경찰서에 갔나?<br/>
<hr/>
Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do. What is that?<br/>
원하는 건 뭐든 드릴테니 부탁을 들어주십시오<br/>
<hr/>
That I cannot do. I'll give you anything you ask.<br/>
그건 할 수 없소<br/>
<hr/>
We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me... to your house for a cup of coffee...<br/>
자네는 생전 처음으로 내게 도움을 청하러 왔어<br/>
<hr/>
even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank.<br/>
내 처가 외동딸의 대모인데 말이야<br/>
<hr/>
You never wanted my friendship... and you were afraid to be in my debt.<br/>
솔직해지지 자네는 상납이 싫어서<br/>
<hr/>
I didn't want to get into trouble. I understand.<br/>
말썽에 연루될까봐 그랬죠<br/>
<hr/>
You had a good trade, made a good living. Police protected you, and there were courts of law. So you didn't need a friend like me.<br/>
민중의 지팡이인 경찰과 정의를 지키는 법원이 있으니<br/>
<hr/>
But now you come to me and you say... "Don Corleone, give me justice."<br/>
그런데 지금은<br/>
<hr/>
But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship.<br/>
존경심을 보이거나<br/>
<hr/>
You don't even think to call me "Godfather."<br/>
우정을 구하긴 커녕 날 대부라고 부르지 조차 않으면서<br/>
<hr/>
Instead, you come into my house... on the day my daughter is to be married... and you ask me to do murder for money. I ask you for justice.<br/>
딸애의 결혼식날 돈을 준다며 살인을 요청하고 있지<br/>
<hr/>
That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive. They must suffer then as she suffers.<br/>
정의는 그런 게 아냐 자네 딸은 살아있어<br/>
<hr/>
How much shall I pay you?<br/>
얼마면 되겠습니까?<br/>
<hr/>
then the scum that ruined your daughter...would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance... an honest man like yourself should make enemies...<br/>
놈들은 당장 죽어 없어질 거다<br/>
<hr/>
then they would become my enemies.<br/>
자네에게 적이 있다면 바로 나의 적이 될 테니<br/>
<hr/>
And then they would fear you.<br/>
자네를 건들지 못 하지<br/>
<hr/>
Be my friend?<br/>
친구가 돼주십시오<br/>
<hr/>
Godfather.<br/>
대부님<br/>
<hr/>
Someday, and that day may never come... I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day...<br/>
언젠가 자네가 필요한 일이 생기면 부르겠네<br/>
<hr/>
accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day. Grazie, Godfather.<br/>
이 정의를 내 딸의 결혼 선물로 치지<br/>
<hr/>
I want reliable people... people that aren't going to be carried away. I mean, we're not murderers... in spite of what this undertaker says.<br/>
매끄럽게 처리할 믿음직한 사람이 필요해<br/>
<hr/>
-Where's Michael? -What?<br/>
- 마이클은 어디 있지?<br/>
<hr/>
We're not taking it. We're not taking the picture without Michael.<br/>
마이클이 없으면 사진 안 찍는다<br/>
<hr/>
-What's the matter, Sonny? -It's Michael.<br/>
- 왜 그러시는 거지?<br/>
<hr/>
Don Barzini.<br/>
어서 오게<br/>
<hr/>
Hey, Paulie!<br/>
이봐, 폴리!<br/>
<hr/>
Paulie! More wine.<br/>
술 갖고 오라니까!<br/>
<hr/>
You look "terrif" on the floor.<br/>
- 춤 솜씨가 대단하시네요<br/>
<hr/>
Go take a walk around the neighborhood. Do your job.<br/>
- 일 안 하고 남 춤추는 것만 봤어?<br/>
<hr/>
Sandra, come on.<br/>
산드라, 애들 좀 잘 봐 까불고 다니지 못 하게 해<br/>
<hr/>
Twenty or thirty grand. In small bills, cash. In that little silk purse.<br/>
봉투 하나 하나에 2천, 3천이라...<br/>
<hr/>
If this was somebody else's wedding. Hey, Paulie! I got two gobbagool... gabagol and a prosciutto.<br/>
우리 같은 사람들은 꿈도 못 꿀 일이지<br/>
<hr/>
