Before Rome, before Babylon, before the pyramids, there was kahndaq.<br/>

Came king ahk-ton.<br/>

<hr/>
If infused with the powers of the six demons of the ancient world... It would make ahk-ton invincible.<br/>

<hr/>
To make the crown, he needed eternium.<br/>
要制造王冠，他需要永恒矿石<br/>
<hr/>
A rare mineral of magic properties, found only in kahndaq. So he enslaved his own people<br/>

But the crown had already been completed.<br/>
