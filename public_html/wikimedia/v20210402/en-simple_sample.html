Personification is a form of figurative language known simply as a figure of speech, which applies human qualities to objects of a most inanimate nature, it also applies to concepts, and non human mammals (commonly known as animals). <br/>
Personification is a figure of speech where human qualities are given to animals, objects or ideas. <br/>
<hr/>
In the arts(which is a theory surrounding the physical expression of creativity found in the cultures of human society) personification is used to represent non human things as if they were human, means representing a non-human thing as if it were human. Personification gives human traits and qualities, such as emotions, desires, sensations, gestures and speech, often by way of a metaphor. <br/>
