Bernard Desclot (in Catalan: Bernat Desclot) was a Catalan chronicler whose work covering the brief reign of Peter III of Aragon (1276–85) forms one of the four Catalan Grand Chronicles through which the modern historian views thirteenth- and fourteenth century military and political matters in the Kingdom of Aragon and the Principality of Catalonia,[1] including the "Aragonese Crusade". Desclot's Chronicle begins in the eleventh century but gains especial interest when he comes to describe events current within living memory. Bernard's literary model was Romance, and his account is spiced with dramatic monologues of the central characters and thrilling episodes, such as the escape of Peter's brother, James II of Majorca, from the fortress of Perpignan, through the castle's drains. <br/>

His experiments in distillation led to the discovery of what he termed aqua vitæ, or usually quinta essentia, and commended as a panacea for all disease. His work as an alchemist forms the subject-matter of De consideratione quintæ essentiæ (Basle, 1561) and De extractione quintæ essentiæ; likewise Libellus de conficiendo vero lapide philosophico ad sublevandam inopiam papæ et cleri in tempore tribulationis (Strasburg, 1659). <br/>

Moselle Romance is an extinct Romance Language that developed after the fall of the Roman Empire along the Moselle river in modern-day Germany, near the border with France. <br/>

Despite heavy Germanic influence, it persisted in isolated pockets as late as the 11th century. <br/>

Historical Background <br/>

<hr/>
After Julius Caesar conquered Gaul in 50 b.c. a Gallo-Roman culture gradually developed in what is today France, southern Belgium, Luxembourg, and the region between Trier and Koblenz. <br/>
Postea quam [[Gaius Iulius Caesar|Caesar]] vicit [[Galliam|Gallia]] anno 50 a.C.n., gens Galloromana ibi exculta est. <br/>
<hr/>
By contrast, the adjacent province of Germania Inferior and part of Germania Superior retained a Germanic character throughout the Imperial period. <br/>
In [[Germania Inferior|Germania Inferiore]] autem et in marginibus [[Germania Superior|Germaniae Superioris]] qui Galliae vicini sunt, gens Germana permanuit usque ad occasum Imperii. <br/>

Emergence of Moselle Romance <br/>

<hr/>
The Angles and Saxons, en route to England from their ancestral lands in the western Netherlands and Germany, carved a path through Holland, Flanders, and Brabant and sent the local Franks fleeing southeast along the Ourthe and Sauer rivers to the region around Metz and the Upper Moselle. <br/>
Ab Anglis et Saxonibus profectis a patriis suis ad [[Britannia|Britanniam]] insulam, qui transiebant per [[Hollandia|Hollandiam]], [[Flandria|Flandriam]], Brabant, fugati sunt [[Franci|]] in vulturnum juxta flumina Ourthe et Sauer in fines [[Mettis|Mettienses]] et superiorem Mosellam. <br/>
<hr/>
This drove a sixty-kilometer wedge between the Gallo-Romans in the Trier-Koblenz area and their linguistic brethren in the rest of Gaul. <br/>
Itaque spatio 60 chilometrorum diviserunt Mosellienses a ceteris Galloromanis. <br/>
<hr/>
Judging by the archeological evidence, these newly arrived Franks practiced farming and animal husbandry about Bitburg, Gutland, the Middle and Upper Saar, and the Moselle Valley- strongly preferring these last two over the others. <br/>
Vestigiis archaeologicis perspectis, videtur eos agrum coluisse et educavisse pecora circa Bitburg, Gutland, medium [[Saravus|Saravum]], postera duo quorum potissimum frequentantes. <br/>

The local Gallo-Roman placenames suggest that the left bank of the Moselle was Germanized following the 8th century, but the the right bank remained Romance-speaking into at least the 10th century. <br/>

This being a wine-growing region, a number of viticultural terms from Moselle Romance have survived in the local German dialect. <br/>

Pannonian Romance was a Romance language that developed in Pannonia after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It seems to have lasted until the 10th century. The development of Pannonian Romance shows some similarities with that of British Romance, lasting only a few centuries. <br/>
Romanica Pannonienses est lingua romana quae in Pannonia floruit Imperio Romano lapso. Videtur exstincta esse saeculo X. <br/>
<hr/>
The Romanized population of Pannonia (for which the historian Theodor Mommsen calculated a population of about 200,000 around the 4th century) survived Barbarian invasions (by the Huns, Goths, Avars and others), although they were reduced to few thousands by the 6th century, living mainly in fortified villages like Keszthely and Fenékpuszta. <br/>
Romanopannonienses, quorum numerum Theodor Mommsen historicus credebat 200,000 fuisse circa saeculum III, multas incursiones Hunnorum, Gothorum, Avarorum, etc subierant quibus in pauca milia redacti sunt saeculo XI ineunte. Deinde maxima restantium pars latebat in oppidis munitis ut Keszthely et Fenélpuszta. <br/>
<hr/>
There were other places in Pannonia where local population continued to speak forms of Vulgar Latin after the 5th century: Pécs, Sopron, Szombathely, Dunaújváros. Many Christian relics with inscriptions in Latin have been found in these towns. <br/>
Eos autem liquet et in aliis Pannoniae partibus remanuisse post saeculum V, nam multae Christianorum reliquiae repertae sunt Sopianiis, Scarbantiae, Savariae (i.e. Pécs, Sopron, Szombathely), Tokod, Dunaújváros. <br/>

But it was on the western shore of the Lake Pelso (now called Lake Balaton) where a peculiar society of craftsmen formed, called the Keszthely culture, of which more than 6,000 artisan tombs and many products (including in gold) are left. <br/>
Societas fabrorum romanopannoniensium exorta est in laci Pelsodis litore quod ad occidentem vergit. Posteris reliquerunt plus 6,000 sepulcra et multa opuscula, nonnulla quorum aurea sunt. <br/>
<hr/>
Romance dialects disappeared due to assimilation with German and Slavic invaders in borders areas of the Roman limes near the Danube river in Pannonia, Raetia (today Bavaria and Switzerland) and Noricum (today Austria),[3] but in the area of Lake Balaton survived because the Avars needed a population of skilled artisans and craftsmen for their own needs. <br/>
Ceteri romanici qui iuxta Danuvium vixerant invadentibus germanicis et slavonicis succubuerant; haud autem qui iuxta Pelsodem versabantur, quos [[Avari]] magni aestimabant quia opuscula eis fabricarent. <br/>
<hr/>
After the Avars were defeated by Charlemagne and disappeared at the beginning of the 9th century, the Romanized craftsmen of the "Keszthely culture" were no longer needed and so quickly were assimilated: their language, Pannonian Romance, soon disappeared with them in the 10th century.[4] <br/>
