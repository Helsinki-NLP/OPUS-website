The Meitei calendar (Meitei: ꯃꯩꯇꯩ ꯊꯥꯄꯥꯂꯣꯟ) or Manipuri calendar (Meitei: ꯃꯅꯤꯄꯨꯔꯤ ꯊꯥꯄꯥꯂꯣꯟ) or Kangleipak calendar (Meitei: ꯀꯪꯂꯩꯄꯥꯛ ꯊꯥꯄꯥꯂꯣꯟ) or Maliyapham Palcha Kumshing (Meitei: ꯃꯂꯤꯌꯥꯐꯝ ꯄꯥꯜꯆꯥ ꯀꯨꯝꯁꯤꯡ) is a lunisolar calendar used by the Meitei people of Manipur for their religious as well as agricultural activities. The concept of era in Meitei was first developed by Emperor Maliyafam Palcha, in the year 1397 BC (Palcha Era)[1] in the kingdom of Kangleipak in present-day Manipur. It is believed that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th months of the Meitei calendar were named after Poireiten's agricultural activities. <br/>
