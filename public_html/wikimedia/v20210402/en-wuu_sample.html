(Italian: [matˈtɛːo ˈrittʃi]; October 6, 1552 – May 11, 1610), was an Italian Jesuit priest and one of the founding figures of the Jesuit China missions. His 1602 map of the world in Chinese characters introduced the findings of European exploration to East Asia. He is considered a Servant of God in Roman Catholicism. <br/>
利玛窦，(Italian: [matˈtɛːo ˈrittʃi]; 1552.10.6 – 1610.5.11), 意大利籍天主教耶稣会神父，天主教耶稣会勒中国传教个开拓者之一。伊绘制个《坤舆万国全图》首次担欧洲地理大发现个成果介绍到东亚地区。天主教会勒1984年授予伊天主之仆称号。 <br/>
<hr/>
Ricci arrived at the Portuguese settlement of Macau in 1582 where he began his missionary work in China. He became the first European to enter the Forbidden City of Beijing in 1601 when invited by the Wanli Emperor, who sought his selected services in matters such as court astronomy and calendrical science. He converted several prominent Chinese officials to Catholicism, such as his colleague Xu Guangqi, who aided in translating Euclid's Elements into Chinese as well as the Confucian classics into Latin for the first time. <br/>
利玛窦勒1582年抵达澳门开始仔伊勒中国个传教。伊勒1601年获准居住北京，并为明神宗一朝提供天文搭历法方面个咨询。伊也是第一位进入紫禁城个欧洲人。利玛窦个信徒中有交关著名个公卿大臣，其中包括伊个同事，也是后首来影响顶大个、进士出身个翰林徐光启。利玛窦搭徐光启合作首次翻译了欧几里得个《几何原本》中文版本以及交关拉丁文版个儒家经典著作。 <br/>

While there, in addition to philosophy and theology, he also studied mathematics, cosmology, and astronomy under the direction of Father Christopher Clavius. In 1577, he applied for a missionary expedition to the Far East. He sailed from Lisbon, Portugal in March 1578 and arrived in Goa, a Portuguese Colony, the following September. <br/>
1552年10月6日，利玛窦生勒教皇国马切塔拉城（现属意大利马凯尔大区）。伊勒家乡接受传统教育，之后勒罗马学了两年法律。利玛窦于1571年4月勒耶稣会主办个罗马学院学习期间加入了耶稣会，同时勒克里斯托佛·克拉乌神父个指导下学习哲学，数学，宇宙学，搭天文学。1577年获准前往远东传教。利玛窦一行勒1578年3月从里斯本启程，并勒同年9月抵达葡萄牙勒亚洲顶重要个殖民地--印度果阿邦。伊勒果阿当地传教四年并且勒当地神学院还学习人文学科，直到1582年应召前往中国。利玛窦勒1582年8月7日抵达澳门[1] <br/>

利玛窦从澳门去北京个路线 <br/>
<hr/>
In August 1582, Ricci arrived at Macau, a Portuguese trading post on the South China Sea. At the time, Christian missionary activity in China was almost completely limited to Macau, where some of the local Chinese people had converted to Christianity and lived in the Portuguese manner. No Christian missionary had attempted seriously to learn the Chinese language until 1579 (three years before Ricci's arrival), when Michele Ruggieri was invited from Portuguese India expressly to study Chinese, by Alessandro Valignano, founder of St. Paul Jesuit College (Macau), and to prepare for the Jesuits' mission from Macau into Mainland China.[2] <br/>
勒利玛窦达到澳门个辰光，基督教派勒中国个传教活动仅仅局限勒澳门。利玛窦抵到澳门个三年前（1579年），基督教派个传教士还朆系统个学过中文，迭种情况直到澳门圣保罗学院个创始人范礼安搭罗明坚（明朝以来第一位进入中国大陆个西方传教士）开始计划勒中国大陆进行传教之后才有所改观。.[2] <br/>
<hr/>
Once in Macau, Ricci studied Chinese language and customs. It was the beginning of a long project that made him one of the first Western scholars to master Chinese script and Classical Chinese. With Ruggieri, he traveled to Guangdong's major cities, Canton and Zhaoqing (then the residence of the Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi), seeking to establish a permanent Jesuit mission outside Macau.[1] <br/>
利玛窦勒澳门当地努力学习中文搭相关个风俗文化，箇使得伊成为了第一位掌握汉字搭文言个西方学者。期间伊搭罗明坚游历仔广东个主要城市——广州和肇庆，以期建立一所澳门之外个耶稣会教堂。 [1] <br/>

<hr/>
In 1583, Ricci and Ruggieri settled in Zhaoqing, at the invitation of the governor of Zhaoqing, Wang Pan, who had heard of Ricci's skill as a mathematician and cartographer. Ricci stayed in Zhaoqing from 1583 to 1589, when he was expelled by a new viceroy. It was in Zhaoqing, in 1584, that Ricci composed the first European-style map of the world in Chinese, now called the "Impossible Black Tulip"[3] after its rarity. <br/>
利玛窦搭罗明坚勒1583年获得肇庆知府王泮个准许入驻肇庆。利玛窦勒肇庆留驻至1589年直到畀新一任个广州总督刘继文驱逐脱。勒肇庆期间（1584年）利玛窦绘制了第一幅中文版本个欧式世界地图。尽管1584年版个地图嘸沒流传下来，1602年个六份复刻版本个地图得以保存至今。[3] [4] <br/>
<hr/>
It is thought that, during their time in Zhaoqing, Ricci and Ruggieri compiled a Portuguese-Chinese dictionary, the first in any European language, for which they developed a system for transcribing Chinese words in the Latin alphabet. The manuscript was misplaced in the Jesuit Archives in Rome, rediscovered only in 1934, and published only in 2001.[5][6] <br/>
勒肇庆期间利玛窦搭罗明坚编纂了一部葡中对照字典，箇是第一部担汉字翻译成拉丁字母个字典。1934年字典抄本勒罗马耶稣会存档裏向畀发现，后首来勒2001年出版。 [5][6] <br/>
<hr/>
There is now a memorial plaque in Zhaoqing to commemorate Ricci's six-year stay there, as well as a "Ricci Memorial Centre"[7] in a building dating from the 1860s. <br/>
目前肇庆市造仔“利玛窦纪念中心”[7] 以纪念利玛窦勒肇庆箇六年个传教工作。 <br/>
<hr/>
Expelled from Zhaoqing in 1589, Ricci obtained permission to relocate to Shaoguan (Shaozhou, in Ricci's account) in the north of the province, and reestablish his mission there.[8] <br/>
离开肇庆之后利玛窦获准移居至韶州（乃朝叫韶关）并勒此地继续传教。勒韶州，利玛窦攻读了《四书》，并首次将之译为拉丁文。为了更方便与中国的官员交往，在征得范礼安的同意后，从1594年起，利玛窦开始蓄发留须，并穿起了当时儒士的服装。.[8] <br/>
<hr/>
In August 1597, Alessandro Valignano (1539–1606), his superior, appointed him Major Superior of the mission in China, with the rank and powers of a Provincial, a charge that he fulfilled until his death.[9] He moved to Tongzhou (a port of Beijing) in 1598, and first reached the capital Beijing itself on 7 September 1598. However, because of a Korean/Japanese war at the time, Ricci could not reach the Imperial Palace. After waiting for two months, he left Beijing; first for Nanjing and then Suzhou in Southern Zhili Province. <br/>
1595年利玛窦借口帮一位北上任职官员之子治病，而获得了去南京个机会。之后伊折返南昌，并获得批准在此居住。1597年8月利玛窦畀范礼安任命为耶稣会中国教区个负责人，由利玛窦全权负责勒中国个传教活动。1598年利玛窦移居通州并勒9月7日第一趟到北京去。但当时辰光正值万历援朝之役，利玛窦无法获得觐见个机会，仅住了两个号头，乃末只好返回，次年再度到达南京搭南直隶首府苏州。.[9] <br/>
<hr/>
During the winter of 1598, Ricci, with the help of his Jesuit colleague Lazzaro Cattaneo, compiled another Chinese-Portuguese dictionary, in which tones in Chinese syllables were indicated in Roman text with diacritical marks. Unlike Ricci's and Ruggieri's earlier Portuguese-Chinese dictionary, this work has not been found.[5] <br/>
1598年冬，利玛窦勒耶稣会同事郭居静个帮助下头编纂了另一本葡中字典，对于中文个音节以罗马字搭变音符号畀出了详尽个注释。然而迭本字典朆能够流传下来。.[5] <br/>
<hr/>
In 1601, Ricci was invited to become an adviser to the imperial court of the Wanli Emperor, the first Westerner to be invited into the Forbidden City. This honour was in recognition of Ricci's scientific abilities, chiefly his predictions of solar eclipses, which were significant events in the Chinese world.[10] He established the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Beijing, the oldest Catholic church in the city.[11] Ricci was given free access to the Forbidden City but never met the reclusive Wanli Emperor, who, however, granted him patronage, with a generous stipend and supported Ricci's completion of the Zhifang waiji, China's first global atlas.[12] <br/>
勒1601年利玛窦受邀成为了明神宗个宫廷顾问，伊也是第一位畀邀请进入紫禁城个西方人。迭份荣誉主要是基于利玛窦个科学知识，勒成功预测了一趟日食之后伊成为了有名个人物。[10] 利玛窦勒北京建立了第一座天主教堂——宣武门天主堂。[11]伊能够自由出入紫禁城，尽管伊搭近乎隐居个明神宗朆谋面歇，皇帝给予个津贴搭支持使得利玛窦完成了第一部欧洲地理学著作《职方外纪》个中文翻译工作。[12] <br/>
<hr/>
Once established in Beijing, Ricci was able to meet important officials and leading members of the Beijing cultural scene and convert a number of them to Christianity. One conversion, which he called "extraordinary", occurred in 1602, when Li Yingshi, a decorated veteran of the Japanese/Korean War and a well-known astrologer and feng shui expert, became a Christian and provided the Jesuits with a wealth of information.[13][14] <br/>
获得勒北京长居个许可之后利玛窦广泛结交公卿大臣搭士大夫，并使得其中一点人转而信奉天主教。勒一趟伊称为非常成功个布道当中利玛窦说服了万历援朝之役中个将领，同时也让著名风水师个李应试改信天主教。李之后给予耶稣会长期个帮助。.[13][14] <br/>
<hr/>
Ricci was also the first European to learn about the Kaifeng Jews,[15] being contacted by a member of that community who was visiting Beijing in 1605. Ricci never visited Kaifeng, Henan Province, but he sent a junior missionary there in 1608, the first of many such missions. In fact, the elderly Chief Rabbi of the Jews was ready to cede his power to Ricci, as long as he gave up eating pork, but Ricci never accepted the position.[15] <br/>
利玛窦是第一位知晓开封犹太人存在个欧洲人[15] ，勒拉开封个犹太人社区勒1605年联络伊之后。尽管利玛窦本人朆造访歇开封，但伊派出了年轻个神父访问伊搭。事实浪当地个犹太拉比准备擔职位交畀利玛窦，只要伊放弃喫猪肉，不过利玛窦弗接受。[15] <br/>
<hr/>
The Wanli Emperor granted this request and designated a Buddhist temple for the purpose. In October 1610, Ricci's remains were transferred there.[16] The graves of Ferdinand Verbiest, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, and other missionaries are also there, and it became known as the Zhalan cemetery (Chinese: 栅栏墓地; pinyin: Zhàlán Mùdì). It is now part of the campus of Beijing Administrative College (located at 6 Chegongzhuang Road, Xicheng District, Chinese: 西城区车公庄大街6号; pinyin: Xīchéng Qū Chēgōngzhuāng Dàjiē 6Hào). <br/>
1610年5月11日利玛窦病逝于北京，享年57岁。伊歇明朝政府个惯例是，殁勒中国个外国传教士必须迁回澳门墓地下葬。为仔让利玛窦能够安葬勒北京，借此来认可教会搭天主教勒中国个合法存在，耶稣会庞迪我神父向明神宗上疏，希望能破例赐地埋葬利玛窦。迭份上疏老快得到了万历皇帝个批准。1610年10月，利玛窦迁葬勒万历皇帝所赐个二里沟个滕公栅栏。[16] 朝后交关传教士，包括南怀仁搭汤若望也侪安葬于此。至19世纪末，安葬于滕公栅栏个欧洲传教士已逾百名。利玛窦墓乃朝勒拉北京行政学院内。 <br/>
<hr/>
Ricci was succeeded as Superior General of the China mission by Nicolò Longobardo, in 1610. Longobardo entrusted another Jesuit, Nicolas Trigault, with expanding and editing, as well as translating into Latin, those of Ricci's papers that were found in his office after his death. This work was first published in 1615 in Augsburg as De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas and soon was translated into a number of other European languages.[17] <br/>
利玛窦中国教区负责人个职位由龙华民神父接任。龙华民委托另外一位耶稣会神父金尼阁擔利玛窦个著述编译成拉丁文。迭些著述勒1615年以《耶稣会在中国个传教》为名出版并畀翻译成多国文字。 [17] <br/>

<hr/>
Ricci could speak Chinese as well as read and write classical Chinese, the literary language of scholars and officials. He was known for his appreciation of Chinese culture in general but condemned the prostitution which was widespread in Beijing at the time.[18] During his research, he discovered that in contrast to the cultures of South Asia, Chinese culture was strongly intertwined with Confucian values and therefore decided to use existing Chinese concepts to explain Christianity. He did not explain the Catholic faith as entirely foreign or new; instead, he said that the Chinese culture and people always believed in God and that Christianity is simply the completion of their faith.[19] He borrowed an unusual Chinese term, Lord of Heaven (Chinese: 天主; pinyin: Tiānzhǔ), which is based on the theistic Zhou term "Heaven", to use as the Catholic name for God. <br/>
利玛窦能熟练读写中国文言，箇是当时官员以及士大夫们使用个语言。总体而言伊对中国文化表示欣赏，但有记录显示伊对广泛存在勒北京个妓院表示谴责。搭伊勒南亚个经历弗同，利玛窦发现中国文化搭儒学紧密联系，乃末决定运用中国文化当中已有个概念去诠释基督宗教。伊朆拿宗教信仰诠释为西方个或者对于中国人而言是全新个，而是表示中国文化搭人民长期以来是信仰神个，基督教只是帮助伊拉坚定自家个信仰而已。伊认为中国传统个“天”搭“上帝”本质上较天主教所话个“唯一真神”并无分别，主张以“天主”称呼天主教个“神”。而祭祀祖先搭孔子，迭些只属追思先人搭缅怀哲人个仪式，本质浪并嘸沒违反天主教教义。道明会搭方济各会个传教士觉着嚜利玛窦偏离得忒远，向梵蒂冈申诉利玛窦等人允许中国教徒崇拜祖先，违背了天主教教义。道明会传教士建议教皇派特使到中国晋见康熙皇帝，要求更改利玛窦规矩以排除容许中国传统个传教方式，搭康熙争辩。康熙认为“弗可理喻”，强令传教士遵从，否则逐回。此即之后个中国礼仪之争事件。.[20][21] <br/>
<hr/>
Like developments in India, the identification of European culture with Christianity led almost to the end of Catholic missions in China, but Christianity continued to grow in Sichuan and some other locations.[20] <br/>
正如勒印度个发展一样，基督教中欧洲文化个强调几乎导致了中国天主教会传教活动个结束（康熙帝于礼仪之争事件后禁止天主教在华传教活动），不过勒四川搭其他一些地方基督教社区仍然保留了下来。[20] <br/>
<hr/>
Ricci became the first to translate some of the Confucian classics into a western language, Latin, with assistance from the scholar Xu Guangqi. <br/>
勒徐光启个协助下头，利玛窦第一趟成功拿一系列儒家经典翻译成拉丁文。 <br/>
<hr/>
Ricci also met a Korean emissary to China, Yi Su-gwang. <br/>
利玛窦勒北京期间还擔天主教经典搭西学传授畀了一位朝鲜派来明朝个特使，李睟光。利玛窦赠与个西学书籍帮助了第一本朝鲜百科全书《芝峰类说》个编写以及朝鲜半岛实学运动个发展。[22] [23] <br/>

The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven <br/>
《天主个真谛》 <br/>
<hr/>
The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven is a book written by Ricci, which argues that Confucianism and Christianity are not opposed and in fact are remarkably similar in key respects. Ricci used the treatise in his missionary effort to convert Chinese literati, men who were educated in Confucianism and the Chinese classics. There was controversy over whether Ricci and other Jesuits had gone too far and changed Christian beliefs to win converts. <br/>
勒《天主的真谛》一书裏向利玛窦声称儒学搭基督教并非对立，勒一眼关键概念浪具有相似性。利玛窦以此勒中国官员搭士大夫之间传教。迭种诠释也引起了伊搭其他耶稣会修士之间关于基督教信仰个争议。 <br/>
<hr/>
Peter Phan argues that True Meaning was used by a Jesuit missionary to Vietnam, Alexander De Rhodes, in writing a catechism for Vietnamese Christians.[citation needed] In 1631, Girolamo Maiorica and Bernardino Reggio, both Jesuit missionaries to Vietnam, started a short-lived press in Thăng Long (present-day Hanoi) to print copies of True Meaning and other texts.[40] The book was also influential on later Protestant missionaries to China, James Legge and Timothy Richard, and through them John Nevius, John Ross, and William Soothill, all influential in establishing Protestantism in China and Korea. <br/>
彼得潘认为耶稣会修士勒越南个传教当中使用仔《天主个真谛》。1631年两位耶稣会派遣至越南个传教士曾经勒河内分发《天主个真谛》一书。迭本书对于后期个新教传教士也有得一定影响。[40] <br/>

There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild,[2] a lifespan exceeded among passerines by only a few Australasian species such as the satin bowerbird[3] and probably the lyrebirds. <br/>
