The ʿĀmu l-Fīl (Arabic: عام الفيل‎, Year of the Elephant) is the name in Islamic history for the year approximately equating to 570 CE. <br/>
Aseggas n Ilu, neɣ Ɛam Ulfil (taɛrabt : عام الفيل), d issem i d-yefka umezruy ineslem i useggas iqerben ɣer 570 seld talalit n Ɛisa. <br/>
<hr/>
According to Islamic tradition, it was in this year that Muhammad (Arabic: مُـحَـمَّـد‎, consonant letters: m-ħ-m-d) was born.[1] The name is derived from an event said to have occurred at Mecca: Abraha, the Abyssinian, Christian ruler of Yemen, which was subject to the Kingdom of Aksum of Ethiopia,[2][3] marched upon the Ka‘bah in Mecca with a large army, which included one or more war elephants, intending to demolish it. <br/>
Amezruy Ineslem yeqqar belli deg useggas-a nnbi n Tineslemt Muḥemmed (taɛrabt: مُـحَـمَّـد‎) ilul.[1] Issem agi yekka-d seg ayen yeḍran di Mekka. Abraha n Ḥabaca, amenbaḍ Amasiḥi n Yaman, igḍefren Tagelda n Aksum di Ityupya,[2][3] yelḥa ɣer Kaɛba di Mekka s yigen ameqqran, deg igen agi llan yiwen neɣ aṭaṣ n ilaten n umgaru, iswi-is ad-tiseɣli (Kaɛba). <br/>
<hr/>
However, the lead elephant, known as 'Mahmud' (Arabic: مَـحْـمُـوْد‎, consonant letters: ħ-m-d),[4] is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca, and refused to enter. <br/>
Akken yeqqar wensay ineslem, ilu amezwaru, yettwasnen s yissem n Meḥmud (Taɛrabt: مَـحْـمُـوْد)[4], ibedd ɣer unekcum n Mekka, d yugi adyekcem. <br/>
<hr/>
It has been theorized that an epidemic such as by smallpox could have caused such a failed invasion of Mecca.[5] The year came to be known as the Year of the Elephant, beginning a trend for reckoning the years in the Arabian Peninsula used, until it was replaced with the Islamic calendar during the rule of ‘Umar. <br/>
Isenmezruyen fkan tiẓri yeqqaren belli aṭṭan yeṭfen ilu nni d ur yeǧǧa-t adyekcem ɣer Mekka.[5] Iferrayen imaynuten deg Unẓul n Tuzunegzirt Taɛrabt ttciciden belli Aseggas n Ilu yeḍra-d di 569 neɣ 568, imi Tgelda n Isasaniyen tseɣli inabaḍen di Yaman igḍefren Tgelda n Aksum di tama n 570.

Academic career <br/>

<hr/>
Professor Mohammed Arkoun (Kabyle: Muḥemmed Arkun; Arabic: محمد أركون‎; 1 February 1928 – 14 September 2010) was an Algerian scholar and thinker. <br/>

<hr/>
He was considered to have been one of the most influential secular scholars in Islamic studies contributing to contemporary intellectual Islamic reform.[1] In a career of more than 30 years, he had been a critic of the tensions embedded in his field of study, advocating Islamic modernism, secularism, and humanism. <br/>

During his academic career, he wrote his numerous books mostly in French, and occasionally in English and Arabic. <br/>

He appeared on numerous occasions on French TV and magazines, on Berbère Télévision speaking in Kabyle, his mother tongue, and on Al Jazeera speaking in Arabic. <br/>

Arkoun was born in 1928 in Taourirt Mimoun, a Berber village in Great Kabylia in northern Algeria. <br/>

His family were traditional religious and relatively poor. <br/>

His father was a shopkeeper in Ain al-Arba'a, a wealthy French settlement in east of Oran. <br/>

He attended primary school in his Berber-speaking home village until he was nine-years-old. As the eldest son, he was expected to learn his father’s trade, while continuing to attend primary school.[2] He studied at the Faculty of Literature of the University of Algiers and at the Sorbonne in Paris (agrégé in Arabic language and Literature, 1956 and Ph.D., 1968). He established his academic reputation with his studies of the history and philosophy of Ibn Miskawayh. <br/>

As he began to consider how one might rethink Islam in the contemporary world, his questioning provided a counterpoint to the predominant interpretations of both the Muslim world and the non-Muslim West. As the editor of Arabica, he broadened the journal's scope, and played a significant role in shaping Western-language scholarship on Islam. He is the author of numerous books in French, English and Arabic, including most recently: Rethinking Islam (Boulder, Colorado, 1994), L'immigration: défis et richesses (Paris, 1998) and The Unthought in Contemporary Islamic Thought (London, 2002).[3] His shorter studies have appeared in many academic journals and his works have been translated into several languages. <br/>

The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is the deity of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Pastafarianism. <br/>

<hr/>
Pastafarianism (a portmanteau of pasta and Rastafarianism) is a social movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion and opposes the teaching of intelligent design and creationism in public schools. <br/>
Tapastafaṛianit d amussu amezday ig-ttsemmilen axeẓẓeṛ urid d amaglay n wajjed, d igeḍḍel aselmed n Wugniw Amegzu, neɣ tamacahut n Adem d Ḥewwa. Imaḍfaṛen ines qqaṛen fell-as belli d ajjed n tidett, am Tineslemt, Tamasiḥit, Tudayt... <br/>
<hr/>
According to adherents, Pastafarianism is a "real, legitimate religion, as much as any other".[3] In New Zealand, Pastafarian representatives are authorized to officiate weddings.[4][5][6] However, in the United States, a federal judge has ruled that the "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster" is not a real religion.[7] In August 2018 the Dutch Council of State also ruled that Pastafarianism is not a religion.[8] <br/>

The "Flying Spaghetti Monster" was first described in a satirical open letter written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the Kansas State Board of Education decision to permit teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in public school science classes.[1] In the letter, Henderson demanded equal time in science classrooms for "Flying Spaghetti Monsterism", alongside intelligent design and evolution.[10] After Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became an Internet phenomenon and a symbol of opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools.[11] <br/>
