The Gulf of California (also called Sea of Cortez or Sea of Cortés; and nearby is known in the Spanish language as Mar de Cortés or Mar Bermejo or Golfo de California) is an area of water that is in between the Baja California Peninsula and Mexican mainland. <br/>
Ghuba ya California (pia Bahari ya Cortez, inajulikana kwa lugha ya Kihispania kama Mar de Cortes au Golfo de California) sehemu ya bahari iliyopo kati ya rasi ya Baja California na Meksiko bara. <br/>
<hr/>
It is surrounded by the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, and Sinaloa. <br/>
Imepakana na majimbo ya Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, na Sinaloa . <br/>
<hr/>
The name "Gulf of California" is on most maps in English today. <br/>
Kwenye ramani za kimatifa huitwa zaidi "Ghuba ya Kalifornia". <br/>
<hr/>
The name "Sea of Cortés" is the one preferred by local people. Francisco de Ulloa named it for Hernán Cortés, who sent him to explore the coast. <br/>
Watu wa maeneo jirani hupendelea jina "Bahari ya Cortes" kwa kumbukumbu ya Hernando Cortes, mtekaji Mhispania wa Mexiko. <br/>
<hr/>
The Gulf was made 5.3 million years ago, changing the flow of the Colorado River. Other rivers which also flow into the Gulf of California are the Fuerte, Mayo, Sinaloa, Sonora, and the Yaqui. Its area is about 160,000 km² (62,000 square miles). <br/>
Eneo lake ni kama km² 160,000. <br/>
<hr/>
The Gulf of California was made as parts of the planets surface moved the Baja California Peninsula off of the North American Plate. As part of this process, the East Pacific Rise formed along the middle of the Gulf along the bottom of the sea. The Gulf would go as far as Indio, California if there wasn't a large river delta made by the Colorado River. <br/>
Ghuba ya California ilitokea miaka milioni 5.3 iliyopita kutokana na miendo katika ganda la Dunia iliyoitenga na bamba la Amerika ya Kaskazini . fanywa kama sehemu za uso wa sayari zilipohamisha Hifadhi ya Baja California mbali na Bamba la Amerika Kaskazini. <br/>
<hr/>
This delta blocks the sea from flooding the Mexicali and Imperial Valleys. Volcanoes can be found along the East Pacific Rise. <br/>
Volkeno zilitokea katika mchkato huo na kisiwa cha Isla Tortuga ni mfano mmoja wa volkano zinazopatikana. <br/>
<hr/>
The island of Isla Tortuga is one example of the volcanoes found.[1] <br/>
[1] <br/>
<hr/>
The Gulf of California has two large islands, the Isla Ángel de la Guarda and Tiburón Island. It also has several smaller ones, including Isla Espiritu Santo and Isla Partida which is joined to it by a small bit of land. <br/>
Ndani ya ghuba kuna visiwa viwili vikubwa, Isla Ángel de la Guarda na Kisiwa cha Tiburon, pamoja na visiwa vingine vidogo. <br/>

<hr/>
Its north edge is the Arafura Sea; the sea between Australia and New Guinea. At its mouth, the Gulf is 590 km wide, and further south, 675 km. <br/>
Pande za kusini, magharibi na mashariki iko Australia bara, upande wa kaskazini iko Bahari ya Arafura iliyopo baina Australia na Guinea Mpya . <br/>
<hr/>
The north south distance is more than 700 km. It covers a water area of about 300,000 km². <br/>
Kwenye kinywa chake, ghuba ina upana wa km 590, urefu wa kaskazini hadi kusini ni km700. <br/>
<hr/>
The gulf is between 55 and 66 meters deep, although there are spots as deep as 82 meters.[1] In the last ice age the Gulf would have been dry land. <br/>
Eneo la maji ni takribani km² 300,000. Maji yake huwa na kina kati ya mita 55 hadi 66, ingawa kuna zenye mita 82. [1] <br/>
<hr/>
The land around the Gulf is generally flat and low-lying. To the west is Arnhem Land, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and Groote Eylandt, the largest island in the Gulf. To the east is the Cape York Peninsula. <br/>
Ardhi karibu na ghuba kwa jumla ni tambarere bila miinuko mikubwa. <br/>
<hr/>

<hr/>
The dry season lasts from about April until November and is has very dry southeast to east winds, caused by winter high pressure systems to the south. <br/>
Msimu mkavu hudumu kutoka Aprili hadi Novemba na ina upepo mkavu sana kutoka mashariki. <br/>
<hr/>
The wet season lasts from December to March. <br/>
Msimu wa mvua huanza mwezi wa Disemba ikiendelea hadi Machi. <br/>
<hr/>
Most of the year's rainfall is happens in these months, and many low-lying areas are flooded. <br/>
Maeneo mengi kando la ghuba hujaa mafuriko. <br/>

<hr/>
The northern tip of the gulf is the Bay of Bangkok at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River. <br/>
Ncha ya kaskazini ya ghuba ni Hori ya Bangkok kwenye mdomo wa Mto Chao Phraya . <br/>
<hr/>
The gulf is about 320,000 km². <br/>
Eneo la maji ni karibu km² 320,000. <br/>
<hr/>
The boundary of the gulf is defined by the line from Cape Bai Bung in southern Vietnam to the city Kota Baru on the Malaysian coast. <br/>
Mpaka wa ghuba hufafanuliwa na mstari kutoka Rasi Bai Bung kusini mwa Vietnam hadi mji wa Kota Baru kwenye pwani ya Malaysia. <br/>
<hr/>
The Gulf of Thailand is relatively shallow. <br/>
Ghuba ya Thailand haina kina kirefu. <br/>
<hr/>
Its average depth is 45 m, and the maximum depth only 80 m. <br/>
Kina cha wastani ni mita 45, na kina cha juu ni m 80 tu. <br/>
<hr/>
This makes water exchange slow. The strong water inflow from the rivers make the Gulf low in salinity (3.05-3.25%) and rich in sediments. <br/>
Inapokea maji mengi kutoka mito na hivyi uchumvi wa ghuba ni mdhaifu (% 3.05-3.25 pekee). <br/>
<hr/>
The main rivers which empty into the gulf are the Chao Phraya (including its distributary Tha Chin River), Mae Klong and Bang Pakong Rivers at the Bay of Bangkok, and the Tapi River into Bandon Bay in the southwest of the gulf. <br/>
Mito mikuu inayoingia ni Chao Phraya , Mto Mae Klong na Mto Bang Pakong kwenye Hori ya Bangkok, halafu Mto Tapi unaoishia katika Hori ya Bandon kwenye kusini magharibi mwa Ghuba. <br/>
