Vo enye atikutsetse si tso Annona muricata, si enye ati si fe amakpawo dama xesiaxi. <br/>
Soursop is the fruit of Annona muricata, a broadleaf, flowering, evergreen tree. <br/>
<hr/>
Wome nya efe tsofe tututu o. Ebor le xexeame fe akpa siwo xor dzp abe Amerika dukor ade wo me.[4] Ebor le Afrika dukorwo me ha. Edo fome kpakple Annona ti fomea, as cherimoya eye wole Annonaceae fomea me. <br/>
The exact origin is unknown; it is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is widely propagated.[4] It is in the same genus, Annona, as cherimoya and is in the Annonaceae family. <br/>
<hr/>
Vo bor de afisiwo me fana akpa le xexeame o elabena fafa naa atikutsetsea gble na. <br/>
The soursop is adapted to areas of high humidity and relatively warm winters; temperatures below 5 °C (41 °F) will cause damage to leaves and small branches, and temperatures below 3 °C (37 °F) can be fatal. The fruit becomes dry and is no longer good for concentrate. <br/>
<hr/>
Vo fe vivivi le abe ne wo blu strawberries kple apple, kple akutu veve gake eme borbor abe agorti ne alo akordu ene. <br/>
The flavour of the fruit has been described as a combination of strawberries and apple, with sour citrus flavour notes contrasting with an underlying creamy texture reminiscent of coconut or banana. <br/>
<hr/>
Amewo gede xorse be atenu adagbe le kansa nu gake esia mele eme o.[5] <br/>
Soursop is widely promoted (sometimes as "graviola") as an alternative cancer treatment. There is, however, no medical evidence that it is effective.[5] <br/>
