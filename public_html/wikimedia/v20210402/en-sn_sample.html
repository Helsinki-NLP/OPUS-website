Mirimi Mathias Kanda (2 June 1942 – 30 October 2009)[1] was a Zimbabwean track and field athlete born in Enkeldoorn [1] who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympic men's marathon,[2] finishing 51st and running 2:41.09 in the marathon. <br/>
Mathias Mirimi Kanda (2 June 1942 - 30 October 2009)[1]+ agaari muZimbabwean mutsara ne munda mutambi vakaberekerwa kuChivhu [1] uyo vaikwikwidzana muna 1964 Summer Olympic makwikwi ewarume [2] wakapedza 51st uye vakamhanya 2: 41,09 vari yedaro refu. <br/>
<hr/>
He was then selected to run in the 1968 Olympic team for Rhodesia, along with fellow Zimbabwean, Bernard Dzoma, but this team was not allowed to compete in the Olympic Games since Rhodesia did not allow black Africans to vote in national elections. <br/>
Akadzosarudzwa kuti kumhanya ari 1968 Olympic chikwata kwaRhodesia, pa kwakunevamwe maZimbabwean, Bernard Dzoma, Asi chikwata ichi hachina kubvumirwa kukwikwidzana mune Olympic Games nekuti Rhodesia haana kubvumira vanhu vatema vomuAfrica kuvhota musarudzo dzenyika. <br/>
<hr/>
Kanda running experiences during this time are detailed by his Australian coach, John Cheffers, in his book: A Wilderness of Spite.[3] <br/>
Kanda ruziwo rwake rwokumhanya panguva ino dzakataurwa namudzidzisi wake weAustralia John Cheffers, Mubhuku rake rinonzi: A Wilderness Of Spite.[3] <br/>
<hr/>
Winning moments <br/>
Nguva dzekuhwina <br/>
<hr/>
Cheffers felt that Kanda was a medal hope in the Mexican Olympic marathon. <br/>
Cheffers akafunga kuti Kanda hayenenguvha kuwana medal muna Mexican Olympic yedaro refu. <br/>
<hr/>
In the last weekend in June 1968, Kanda won the Zimbabwe/Rhodesian Olympic Marathon trial in Bulawayo (at 4500 feet altitude) in 2:27:04.7 on a cold windy course that had an 8 kilometre raise at the end of the course.[4] On 4 May 1968 Kanda also won a South African marathon championship (at the Libanon Mine Track 20 kilometres from Johannesburg) at 5337 feet in a 2:27:24.8.[5][6] Considering that both races were at significant altitude (with the Libanon Mine Track closer to the 7382 feet of Mexico City) Kanda was well conditioned for running at Mexico City. His Bulawayo time would have taken 6th in the Mexico Olympic marathon. <br/>
Mumakore vhiki mu June 1968, Kanda wakahwina Zimbabwe / Rhodesian Olympic Marathon kuyitwa kuBulawayo (nenguva 4500 nekuyenda netsoka) muna 2: 27: 04.7 panguva dzechando kwanendzira yayine 8 kiromita kwekupera kwendzira.[4] kuna 4 chivabvu 1968 uye Kanda wahwina futhi South African yedaro refu Championship zvakare ( kuLibanon ndzira yeMine maKilomita 20 chete kuchibva kuJohannesburg) pa 5337 {nekuyenda netsoka} ari 2: 27: 24.8.[5][6] Kuwedzera nekuti marudzi wose maviri vaiva chete nekukwirira. (neLibanon Mine Track paduze ne7382 {nekuyenda netsoka} Mexico City). Kanda wakagadzirirwa tsime kumanya ku Mexico Olympic yedaro refu.Nguva akazitora kuBulawayo yayifanira kutowa zwakawedzerwa ne 6 kuMexico Olympic yedaro refu. <br/>
<hr/>
He won Republic of South Africa marathon championships in 1964, 1968 and 1969 and, as of 2013, tied with several others as a runner who has won the most marathon championships in South African running history.[5] <br/>
Akawina Republic of South Africa yedaro refu Championships muna 1964, 1968 uye 1969 manje ,Zwa 2013, zwakasungirirwa nevamwe vanoverengeka sezvo mumhanyi anenge akawina daro refu yakawanda Championships kuSouth African kumhanya zwekarekare. [5] <br/>

Summary of running career <br/>

<hr/>
A 2001 article by the Bulawayo Chronicle summarizes Kanda's running career and has an account of his running career in his own words. <br/>

<hr/>
Concerning his young life: "We traveled long distances to school and as herd-boys. <br/>
Kuti govera uduku hwake "Isu tirikufamba zvikuru kubva kuchikoro nenguva bechi boka-vakoma. <br/>
<hr/>
Endurance became more like an in-born thing and club coaches, later in my life, came in with handy hints. <br/>
Kutsungirira zvakachinja zvihuru sekufanana nechinhu wakazvarwa nayo nekuti futhi semufundisi weboka pamberi pehupenyu wangu, zvakawuya nazo nefungwa dzinoshanda. <br/>
<hr/>
But in all I worked hard for my glory. <br/>
Asi zvose Ndakashanda nesimba nokugwinya kwangu. <br/>
<hr/>
It did not come easy and I was blessed in that I did not drink or smoke which gave me ample time to concentrate in the sport."[7] Kanda's training in the early 1960s involved waking up at 3:00am, going for a training run, then jogging to work (at the Bulawayo City Council), and then going for a training run after work.[7] <br/>
Haina nyore uye ini akakomborerwa kuti handina kumwa kana utsi rakandigutsa Jafeti nguva pfungwa Mutambo wacho. "[7] kurovedza Kanda ari mangwanani Kuma1960 zvaisanganisira uchimuka nenguva 3:00 am, kuenda kuti kurovedza kumanya, ipapo kumanyira kubasa (kuti kuBulawayo City Council), uye ipapo kuenda kuti kurovedza kumanya pashure basa.

The morphology of the two languages is similar in other respects: Both retain the old present conjugation in the verb (Domari kar-ami ‘I do’), and consonantal endings of the oblique nominal case (Domari mans-as ‘man.OBL’, mans-an ‘men.OBL’), and both show agglutination of secondary (Layer II) case endings (Domari mans-as-ka ‘for the man’). It had therefore been assumed that Romani and Domari derived form the same ancestor idiom, and split only after leaving the Indian subcontinent. ↑ "What is Domari?". University of Manchester. <br/>
