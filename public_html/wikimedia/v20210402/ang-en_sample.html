Eþeling (ᛟ) is a political, social, and economic ideology and movement characterized by the promotion of the interests of a particular eþel,[1] especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the eþeling's sovereignty (self-governance) over its hāmland. <br/>
Nationalism is a political, social, and economic ideology and movement characterized by the promotion of the interests of a particular nation,[1] especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation's sovereignty (self-governance) over its homeland. <br/>
<hr/>
Eþeling holds that each eþel should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a eþel is a natural and ideal basis for a polity,[2] and that the eþel is the only rightful source of political power (popular sovereignty).[1][3] It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity—based on shared social characteristics such as culture, language, religion, politics, and belief in a shared singular history[4][5] [page needed]—and to promote national unity or solidarity.[1] Eþeling, therefore, seeks to preserve and foster a eþel's traditional culture, and cultural revivals have been associated with nationalist movements.[6] It also encourages pride in national achievements, and is closely linked to patriotism.[7] [page needed] Eþeling is often combined with other ideologies, such as conservatism (national conservatism) or socialism (socialist nationalism) for example.[2] <br/>

Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. <br/>
