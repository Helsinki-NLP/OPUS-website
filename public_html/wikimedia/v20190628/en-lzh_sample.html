(src)="207556"> The term has several related and differing definitions throughout time . <br>
(src)="207557"> In its original literary form , it refers to those of prominent and wealthy backgrounds . <br>
(src)="207558"> In modern use , the term has also became a popular slang used to describe the nouveau riche . <br>
(src)="207559"> Pejoratively , the internet slang can be understood to carry on the meaning of " uncouth nouveau riche " , " tacky " or " extravagant".[1 ] <br>
(trg)="982"> 土豪 ( tǔháo ) ， 乃華夏一網際名題 ， 現意指富庶之人 。 原意為家世顯赫 ， 族中錢權皆備者 。 建國左派思潮中亦指迫民的土匪惡霸 ， 現亦可以此稱暴富之人 。 而略有口語之感 ， 抑或含戲謔諷刺之意 （ 粗俗 ， 蠻橫 ） 。 [ 1 ] <br>

(src)="207567"> However , in taking this to the " nth " degree , the term also evinces a new capacity for Chinese to laugh at themselves . <br>
(src)="207568"> Cultural Sociologist Michael Griffiths tells us that , " for consumers in China 's higher-tier cities ( who have already been around this kind of crass materialism for a couple of decades now ) , tuhao represents a tongue-in cheek satire of China 's breakneck pursuit of material affluence in the get-rich-quick era . <br>
