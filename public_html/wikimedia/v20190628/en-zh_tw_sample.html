(src)="457563"> Agnotology ( formerly agnatology ) is the study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt , particularly the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data . <br>
(src)="457564"> The neologism was coined by Robert N. Proctor,[1][2 ] a Stanford University professor specializing in the history of science and technology.[3 ] Its name derives from the Neoclassical Greek word ἄγνωσις , agnōsis , " not knowing " ( confer Attic Greek ἄγνωτος " unknown"[4 ] ) , and -λογία , -logia.[5 ] More generally , the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before . <br>
(trg)="2"> 比較無知學 （ 英文 ： Agnotology ， 曾做agnatology ） 是研究文化中刻意引導的無知或懷疑 ， 尤其是出版錯誤或誤導人的科學資料的現象 。 這個新詞是由羅伯特 · 普羅克特 （ Robert N. Proctor ,  ） 所創造 ， 他是史丹佛大學專長於科學與科技史的教授 .  。 這個字的來源是由古希臘語的字彙  ἄγνωσις （ agnōsis ， 不知道的 ， 來自 <br>

(src)="457569"> A prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance cited by Proctor is the tobacco industry 's advertising campaign to manufacture doubt about the cancer and other health effects of tobacco use . <br>
(src)="457570"> Under the banner of science , the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.[5][7 ] <br>

(src)="457571"> Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do not " come to be , " or are ignored or delayed . <br>
(src)="457572"> For example , knowledge about plate tectonics was censored and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence was classified military information related to undersea warfare.[5 ] <br>

(src)="457575"> The term " agnotology " was first coined in a footnote in Proctor 's 1995 book , The Cancer Wars : How Politics Shapes What We Know and Do n't Know About Cancer : “ Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked – or even , as Johannes Kepler once put it , as the mother who must die for science to be born . <br>
(src)="457576"> Ignorance , though , is more complex than this . <br>
(src)="457577"> It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge . <br>
(src)="457578"> We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies . ” [ 8 ] <br>

(src)="457579"> Proctor was quoted using the term to describe his research " only half jokingly , " as " agnotology " in a 2001 interview about his lapidary work with the colorful rock agate . <br>
(src)="457580"> He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of geologic knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by Theophrastus in 300 BC , relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as diamonds , asbestos , granite , and coal , all of which have much higher commercial value . <br>
(src)="457581"> He said agate was a " victim of scientific disinterest , " the same " structured apathy " he called " the social construction of ignorance."[9 ] <br>
