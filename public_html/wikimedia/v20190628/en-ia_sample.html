(src)="104950"> Unlike many cryptocurrencies that are derivatives of Bitcoin , Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol and possesses significant algorithmic differences relating to blockchain obfuscation.[3][4 ] By providing a high level of privacy , Monero is fungible , meaning that every unit of the currency can be substituted by another unit . <br>
(src)="104951"> These units are indistinguishable from one another . <br>
(src)="104952"> This makes Monero different from public-ledger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , where addresses previously associated with undesired activity can be blacklisted and refused by network members.[5 ] Monero is sometimes employed by Bitcoin users to break link between transactions , with bitcoins first converted to Monero , then after some delay , converted back and sent to an address unrelated to those used before.[6 ] <br>

(src)="104953"> In particular , the ring signatures mix spender 's address with a group of others , making it exponentially more difficult to establish a link between each subsequent transaction.[7][6 ] Also the " stealth addresses " generated for each transaction make it impossible to discover actual destination by anyone else but the address owner . <br>
