(src)="278227"> In the perspective of the history of art,[9 ] artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind : from early pre-historic art to contemporary art ; however , some theories restrict the concept of " artistic works " to modern Western societies.[11 ] One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning , which roughly translates to " skill " or " craft , " as associated with words such as " artisan . " <br>
(src)="278228"> English words derived from this meaning include artifact , artificial , artifice , medical arts , and military arts . <br>
