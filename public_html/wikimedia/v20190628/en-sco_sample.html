(src)="307582"> Some prescriptive English grammars teach that prepositions cannot end a sentence , although there is no rule prohibiting that use.[12][13 ] Similar rules arose during the rise of classicism , when they were applied to English in imitation of classical languages such as Latin . <br>

(src)="307585"> The distinction between simple and complex adpositions is not clear-cut . <br>
(src)="307586"> Many simple adpositions are derived from complex forms ( e.g. , with + in → within , by + side → beside ) through grammaticalisation . <br>
(src)="307587"> This change takes time , and during the transitional stages the adposition acts in some ways like a single word , and in other ways like a multi-word unit . <br>
(src)="307588"> For example , current German orthographic conventions recognize the indeterminate status of certain prepositions , allowing two spellings : anstelle/an Stelle ( " instead of " ) , aufgrund/auf Grund ( " because of " ) , mithilfe/mit Hilfe ( " by means of " ) , zugunsten/zu Gunsten ( " in favor of " ) , zuungunsten/zu Ungunsten ( " to the disadvantage of " ) , zulasten/zu Lasten ( " at the expense of").[15 ] <br>
