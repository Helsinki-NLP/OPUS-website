(src)="435980"> The offspring of an individual contains many parts and properties that are very precise and accurate in what they consist of , and thus what they define for . <br>
(src)="435981"> As the offspring of a new species , also known as a child or f1 generation , consist of genes of the father and the mother , which is also known as the parent generation.[1 ] Each of these offspring contains numerous genes which have coding for specific tasks and properties . <br>
(src)="435982"> Males and females both contribute equally to the genotypes of their offspring , in which gametes fuse and form . <br>
(src)="435983"> An important aspect of the formation of the parent offspring is the chromosome , which is a structure of DNA which contains many genes.[2 ] <br>

[ 2 ] <br>
<hr>
(src)="435984"> To focus more on the offspring and how it results in the formation of the f1 generation , is an inheritance called sex-linkage,[3 ] which is a gene which is located on the sex chromosome and patterns of these inheritance differ in both male and female . <br>
(src)="435985"> The explanation that proves the theory of the offspring having genes from both parent generations , is proven through a process called crossing-over , which consists of taking genes from the male chromosomes and genes from the female chromosome , resulting in a process of meiosis occurring , and leading to the splitting of the chromosomes evenly.[4 ] Depending on which genes are dominantly expressed in the gene will result in the sex of the offspring . <br>
(src)="435986"> The female will always give an X chromosome , whereas the male , depending on the situation , will either give an X chromosome or a Y chromosome . <br>
(src)="435987"> If a male offspring is produced , the gene will consist of an X and a Y chromosome . <br>
(src)="435988"> If two X chromosomes are expressed and produced , it produces a female offspring.[5 ] <br>
(trg)="35"> Ukuqwalasela ngakumbi kwisizalo nasekubeni senzeka njani na isizalo sesizukulwana se-f1 , lufuzo olubizwa ngokuba yi- sex-linkage , [ 3 ] nekuyi-gene ebuthume phaya kwi-sex chromosome kwaye izakhiwo zolu fuzo zahlukile kwinkunzi nakwimazi . <br>

(src)="435989"> Cloning is the production of an offspring which represents the identical genes as its parent . <br>
(src)="435990"> Reproductive cloning begins with the removal of the nucleus from an egg , which holds the genetic material.[6 ] In order to clone an organ , a stem cell is to be produced and then utilized to clone that specific organ.[7 ] A common misconception of cloning is that it produces an exact copy of the parent being cloned . <br>
(src)="435991"> Cloning copies the DNA/genes of the parent and then creates a genetic duplicate . <br>
(src)="435992"> The clone will not be a similar copy as he or she will grow up in different surroundings from the clone and may encounter different opportunities and experiences . <br>
(src)="435993"> Although mostly positive , cloning also faces some setbacks in terms of ethics and human health . <br>

(src)="435995"> Thus , many errors and problems that can occur , which are called mutations . <br>
(src)="435996"> A mutation is any permanent change in an organism 's DNA and thus change in offspring ’s DNA.[8 ] Some mutations can be good as they result in random evolution periods in which may be good for the species , but most mutations are bad as they can change the genotypes of offspring , which can result in changes that harm the species . <br>
(trg)="46"> Nangona ukwahlulwa-hlulwa kwe-cell nokuphindwa-phindwa kwe-DNA izezona zinto zidlala indima enkulu empilweni yomntu , maninzi amanyathelo abandakanyekayo anjengee-enzymes nee-proteins . <br>

<hr>
(src)="436021"> The emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the third world after decolonisation . <br>
(src)="436022"> In the immediate post-war period , development economics , a branch of economics , arose out of previous studies in colonial economics . <br>
(src)="436023"> By the 1960s , an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision.[3 ] Development studies arose as a result of this , initially aiming to integrate ideas of politics and economics . <br>
(src)="436024"> Since then , it has become an increasingly inter- and multi-disciplinary subject , encompassing a variety of social scientific fields.[4 ] In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes . <br>
(src)="436025"> The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the inauguration speech of Harry S. Truman in 1949 . <br>
(src)="436026"> In Point Four of his speech , with reference to Latin America and other poor nations , he said that " for the first time in history , humanity possess[ed ] the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people.".[5 ] But development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries . <br>
(src)="436027"> More recently , the emergence of human security – a new , people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing recognition of a relationship between security and development . <br>
(src)="436028"> Human security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues . <br>
(src)="436029"> This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies . <br>
(trg)="72"> Ukungxamiseka nokuxheshwa kwe-development studies ukuze ibe yi-academic discipline kwihafu yesibini yamashumi amabini enkulungwane yeminyaka , yinto ebekufaneleke ukuba sele ikho nanjengoko kusiya kusanda ukuphawula ngalo mbono wezoqoqosho kwi-third world emva kwe-decolonisation . <br>
(trg)="73"> Ixesha lesaquphe emva kwemfazwe , i-development economics , isebe le-economics , lintshule kwizifundo zangaphambili ezaziqhutywa nge-colonial economics . <br>
(trg)="74"> Ngeminyaka yoo-1960 , ukwanda kwenani leengcali zophuhliso loqoqosho labonakalisa okokuba i-economics iyodwa ayinakujongana ngokupheleleyo nemiba efana nopolitiko olunamandla kunye nemfundo ebekelwe ukuxhasa . [ 3 ] I-Development studies yavela ngenxa yoku , ukuqala kwayo yayijolise ekudibaniseni imibono ye-zopolitiko neyezoqoqosho . <br>
(trg)="75"> Ukusukela ngoko , ibe sisifundo esiluhlobo lwe-inter- and multi-disciplinary , sisisifundo esididiyelwe ngeentlobo-ntlobo ze-social scientific fields . [ 4 ] Kutsha nje kule minyaka igqithileyo ukubaluleka kwe-political economy analysis , ukusetyenziswa kwe-analytical techniques ze-economic , ukuhlola nokucacisa imiba yezopolitiko neyasekuhlaleni , isenokuphakamisa okanye yehlise ukukhula okanye uphuhliso kuyinto esuke yathatha unyawo ngokuthi inwenwele ngakumbi njengendlela yokucacisa impumelelo okanye ukuphanza kweenkqubo zokwakha ngokutsha . <br>

(src)="436221"> Human infants are commonly described as obligate nasal breathers as they prefer breathing through their nose rather than mouth.[3 ] Most infants , however , are able to breathe through their mouth if their nose is blocked.[3 ] There are however certain infants with conditions such as choanal atresia in which deaths have resulted from nasal obstruction.[3 ] In these cases there are cyclical periods of cyanosis . <br>
(src)="436222"> The infant initially attempts to breathe through the nose , and is unable to ; hypercapnia occurs , and many babies instinctively begin to cry . <br>

(src)="436225"> It has also been suggested that infants may not be able to sustain oral breathing for significant lengths of time , because of the weakness of the muscles required to seal the nasal airway and open the oral airway.[3 ] <br>

(src)="436226"> Horses are also considered obligate nasal breathers . <br>
(src)="436227"> The term is more accurate in horses , because their normal anatomy prevents them from breathing orally . <br>
(src)="436228"> The epiglottis rests above the soft palate while the animal is not swallowing , forming an airtight seal . <br>
(src)="436229"> Oral breathing can only occur with significant anatomical abnormalities or pathological conditions . <br>
(src)="436230"> For example , denervation of the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve results in dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP),[4 ] and it has been suggested that this leads to a clinical syndrome which may include oral breathing.[5 ] However , significant respiratory dysfunction including airway obstruction is observed with DDSP , and the animal cannot function normally in this state . <br>

[ 5 ] Nangona kunjalo , ukungaphefumli ngendlela efanelekileyo , kuquka nokuphazamiseka kokuvaleleka komoya ungahambi kakuhle kubonwa kwi- DDSP , kwaye isilwanyana asinakuqhuba kakuhle kule meko .  <br>
<hr>
(src)="436231"> Rabbits and rodents are also obligate nasal breathers . <br>
(src)="436232"> Like horses , the normal anatomical position of the epiglottis causes it to be engaged over the caudal rim of the soft palate , sealing the oral pharynx from the lower airways.[6 ] Even so , rabbits with advanced upper airway disease will attempt to breathe through their mouths . <br>
(trg)="287"> Iimpuku nee-rodents zikwanyanzelekile ukuba ziphefumle ngeempumlo. njengamahashe , indawo le emi kuyo i-epiglottis yenza okokuba isoloko idibana kwi-caudal rim yenkalakahla ethambileyo , kutsho kuvaleke vingci umlomo we-pharynx osuka kumizila yomoya esuka ngezantsi .
