Northern Sotho (Sesotho sa Leboa), also known by the name of its standardised dialect version Sepedi (or Pedi) is a Bantu language spoken primarily in South Africa, where it is one of the 11 official languages. <br/>

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria.[1] Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body.[1] Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.[1] About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those affected.[1] The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.[1] It was historically called "consumption" due to the weight loss.[8] Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.[9] <br/>
Bolwetši bja mafahla (TB) ke bolwetši bja go fetela bjo gantši bo tlholwago ke pakteria ya Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria.[1] Bolwetši bja mafahla gantši bo ama maswafo, gape bo ka ama ditho tše dingwe tša mmele.[1] Diphetedi tše dintši ga di na maswao, tšeo di tsebjago ka la bolwetši bja mafahla bja latent.[1] Palo ya 10% ya diphetedi tša latent di tšwelapele go phetedi ya mafolofolo, yeo, ge a ka tlogelwa e sa alafiwa, e ka bolaya seripa sa palo ya bao ba amegilego.[1] Dišupo tša klasiki tša TB ya mafolofolo ke segohlolo sa go ba manina a go hlakana le madi, letadi, go ela dithitho bošego, le go fokotšega mmele[1] Kgale e be e bitšwa "tirišo/consumption" ka lebaka la go fokotšega ga mmele.[2] Phetelo ya ditho tše dingwe e ka baka mehuta e mentši ya dišupo.[3] <br/>
<hr/>
Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze.[1][10] People with latent TB do not spread the disease.[1] Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke.[1] Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids.[11] Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.[11] <br/>
Bolwetši bja mafahla bo phatlalala ka moya ge batho bao ba nago le TB ya mafolofolo mafahleng a bona ba gohlola, ba tshwa mare, ba bolela goba go ethimola.[1][2] Batho ba go ba le TB ya latent ga ba phatlalatše bolwetši.[1] Phetetši ya mafolofolo e direga gantši go batho bao ba nago le HIV/AIDS gape le go bao ba folago.[1] Phekolo ya TB ya mafolofolo e theilwe godimo ga di-X-ray tša kgara, gammogo le ditlhahlobo tša microscopic le setšo sa diela tša mmele.[3] Phekolo ya TB ya latent e itshepetše go teko ya letlalo ya tuberculin (TST) goba diteko tša madi.[3] <br/>
<hr/>
Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.[3][4][5] Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB.[4] Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time.[4] Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).[1] <br/>
Thibelo ya TB e ama go sekirina bao ba lego kotsing e kgolo, tekolo ya ka pela le dikgetsi tša kalafi, le kenti/vaccination le kenti ya bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).[1][2][3] Bao ba le go kotsing e kgolo ba akaretša batho ka gae, mošomong le dikgokaganyo tša selegae tša batho bao ba phelago ka TB.[2] Phekolo e hloka tirišo ya diantibiotiki tše dintši sebaka se se telele[4] Kganano ya diantibioki ke bothata bjo bo golo kudu bjo bo golago ka e kgolo ya multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) le extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).[4] <br/>
<hr/>
As of 2018 one-quarter of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB.[6] New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year.[12] In 2017, there were more than 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.6 million deaths.[7] This makes it the number one cause of death from an infectious disease.[7] More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines.[7] The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000.[1] About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5–10% of people in the United States population test positive by the tuberculin test.[13] Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.[14] <br/>

First's early work and writings were largely used as evidence to prove treason on behalf of the Congress Alliance.[4] Following four years of harassment by the state, First alongside the 155 other activists were all acquitted of their charges. <br/>

Ruth First's Jewish parents, Julius First and Matilda Levetan, emigrated to South Africa from Latvia in 1906 and became founding members of the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA), the forerunner of the South African Communist Party (SACP). Ruth First was born in 1925 and brought up in Johannesburg. <br/>

After graduating, First worked as a research assistant for the Social Welfare Division of the Johannesburg City Council. <br/>

First then became the editor-in-chief of the radical newspaper The Guardian, which was subsequently banned by the state.[1] Through investigative journalism, First exposed the racial segregation policies known as apartheid, targeting black South Africans following the rise of the National Party in 1948.[2] In 1949 she married Joe Slovo, a South African anti-apartheid activist and Communist, with whom she had three daughters, Shawn, Gillian and Robyn. <br/>

<hr/>
In addition to her work with The Guardian and its successors, the South African Congress of Democrats (COD), a white-only wing of the Congress Alliance, was founded in 1953 with support from First.[3] In 1955, she assumed the position of editor of a radical political journal called Fighting Talk. <br/>

Charlotte Makgomo (née Mannya) Maxeke (7 April 1871[1] – 16 October 1939) was a South African religious leader, social and political activist; she was the first black woman to graduate with a university degree in South Africa with a B.sc from Wilberforce University Ohio in 1903, as well as the first black African woman to graduate from an American university.[2] <br/>

Charlotte Makgomo (née Mannya) Maxeke o belegwe Go la Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape ka di 7 April 1871. <br/>
<hr/>
She was the daughter of John Kgope Mannya, the son of headman Modidima Mannya from Batlokwa people, under Chief Mamafa Ramokgopa and Anna Manci, a Xhosa woman from Fort Beaufort.[3] Mannya's father was a roads foreman and Presbyterian lay preacher, and her mother a teacher.[4] Mannya's grandfather served as a key adviser to the King of the Basutos.[3] Soon after her birth, Mannya's family moved to Fort Beaufort, where her father had gained employment at a road construction company.[3] Details about Mannya's siblings are unclear, however, she had a sister known as Katie, who was born in Fort Beaufort.[5] Mannya's date of birth is in dispute, with possible dates ranging from 1871, 1872 to 1874. <br/>

The Minister of Home Affairs of South Africa, Naledi Pandor, took special interest in this detail of Charlotte Maxeke's life, however, no records were found. <br/>

The date in 1871 is also often accepted as it does not conflict with the age of her younger sister Katie who was born in 1873.[6] <br/>
Letšatši kgwedi la 1871 ke lona leo le amogelegago ka ge le sa ganetšane le matswalo a moratho wa gagwe yo a belegwego 1873.[5] <br/>

At age 8, she began her primary school classes at a missionary school taught by the Reverend Isaac Williams Wauchope in Uitenhage. <br/>
