Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc. (founded as Videocraft International, Ltd. and later known as Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment) was an American production company, known for its seasonal television specials, particularly its work in stop motion animation. <br/>
ʻO Rankin / Bass Productions, Inc. (i hoʻokumuʻia e like me Videocraft International, Ltd. a ma hope aku i kapaʻiaʻo Rankin / Bass Animated Entertainment) he kamupene o ka HuiʻAmelika, iʻikeʻia no kāna mau polokalamu kīwī nui, e like me kāna hana i ka animation animation. <br/>
<hr/>
Rankin/Bass stop-motion features are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts, and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called "Animagic". Often, traditional cel animation scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the effect of a snowfall. <br/>
Hiki keʻikeʻia nā hiʻohiʻona o ka Rankin / Bass ma ko lākouʻano kiʻikuhi likeʻole me nā pūʻupuʻu spheroid, a me ka hau maeʻa ma ka hoʻohanaʻana i kahiʻenehana hanaʻoni "Animagic". ʻO ka manawa pinepine, e hoʻolālāʻia nā hanana hula o ka hiona hau i ka hana e hana i ka hopena o ka hau. <br/>
<hr/>
Nearly all of the studio's animation was outsourced to at least five Japanese animation companies: MOM Production, Toei Animation, TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan), Mushi Production and Topcraft.[2][3] <br/>
Ma kahi kokoke i nā hanana a pau o ka studio, ua hoʻopukaʻia i nā huiʻoihana Japanese heʻelima: MOM Production, Toei Animation, TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan), Mushi Production andcraftcraft. <br/>
<hr/>
The company was founded in New York City by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass on September 14, 1960, as Videocraft International. The majority of Rankin/Bass' work, including all of their "Animagic" stop-motion productions (which they were well known for), were created in Tokyo, Japan. <br/>
Ua hoʻokumuʻia ka hui ma New York City e Arthur Rankin, Jr. a me Jules Bass ma ka lā 14 o Kepakemapa, 1960,ʻoiaiʻo Worldcraft International. ʻO ka hapanui o ka hana Rankin / Bass, me nā mea hana a pau o ka "Animagic" i hanaʻia ma Tokyo, Iapana. <br/>
<hr/>
Throughout the 1960s, the Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator Tadahito Mochinaga at his studio, MOM Production. <br/>
I loko o nā makahiki 1960, ua alakaʻiʻia nā huahana Animagic e ka mea hoʻokani pila a Tadahito Mochinaga ma kāna keena, MOM Production. <br/>
<hr/>
He was credited for his supervision as "Tad Mochinaga" <br/>

McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in early 2018.[4][5][6] <br/>

McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue,[7] serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries[8] across approximately 36,900 outlets as of 2016.[9] Although McDonald's is known for its hamburgers, they also sell cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. <br/>

<hr/>
In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food,[10] the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. <br/>
