Shaka kaSenzangakhona (circa 1787 – 22 September 1828), also known as Shaka[lower-alpha 1] Zulu (Zulu pronunciation: [ˈʃaːɠa]), was one of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu Kingdom. <br/>
Shaka kaSenzangakhona (watalwa ngo 1787 – 22 Mabasa 1828), lophindze atiwe ngekutsi ngu Shaka[lower-alpha 1] Zulu, bekayingwenyama yesive semaZulu waphindze wadlala indzima lebalulekile ekwakheni sive sawo emaZulu. <br/>
<hr/>
The successor to Senzangakhona <br/>
Nakatsatsa Umbuso ku Senzangakhona <br/>
<hr/>
When Senzangakhona (Shaka's father) died in 1816 Shaka's younger half-brother Sigujana assumed power as the legitimate heir to the Zulu chiefdom. <br/>
Babe waShaka bekungu Senzangakhona ka Jama, kwatsi lapho afa khona umbuso watsatfwa ngu Sigujana. <br/>
<hr/>
Sigujana's reign was short however as Shaka, with the help of Dingiswayo and his half brother Ngwadi, had Sigujana assassinated[clarification needed] in a coup that was relatively bloodless and accepted by the Zulu. <br/>
Ngekwemtsetfo bekumele kutsi kube ngu Shaka lotsatsa umbuso kodvwa loku akumange kwenteke ngence yendlela Shaka lokataleka ngayo. <br/>
<hr/>
Thus Shaka became Chief of the Zulu clan, although he remained a vassal of the Mthethwa empire[5] until Dingiswayo's death in battle a year later at the hands of Zwide, powerful chief of the Ndwandwe (Nxumalo) nation. <br/>
Labanyenti ebukhosini bakaZulu bebatsatsa njenge likhuhlela. <br/>
<hr/>
When the Mthethwa forces were defeated and scattered temporarily, the power vacuum was filled by Shaka. <br/>
Kodvwa ngeluncedvo lwabomnakabo Shaka wakhona kutsi umbulale Sigujana. <br/>
<hr/>
He reformed the remnants of the Mthwethwe and other regional tribes and later defeated Zwide in the Zulu Civil War of 1819-20. <br/>
Wakhona nekwakha sive semaZulu. <br/>
<hr/>
Mbandzeni (also known as Dlamini IV, Umbandine,[1] Umbandeen[2] ) (1855–1889) was the King of Swaziland from 1875 until 1889. <br/>
Mbandzeni ( lophindze atiwe nga Dlamini IV, emaNgisi bekamati nga Umbandine,[1] Umbandeen[2] ) (1855–1889) BekayiNkosi yesive sase Swaziland kusukela ngemnyaka wa 1875 kuya ku 1889. <br/>
<hr/>
Ingwenyama Mbandzeni was the son of Mswati II and Nandzi Nkambule.[3][4] His mother the wife of King Mswati had died when he was still very young. <br/>
Ingwenyama Mbandzeni bekayindvodzana ya Mswati II kanye na Nandzi Nkambule.[3][4] Indlovukati ya Mswati yashona mbandzeni amncane. <br/>
<hr/>
Mbandzeni ascended to the throne after his half brother Ludvonga II died before he could become the king.[3] Ludvonga's death resulted in his mother inkhosikati Lamgangeni adopting Mbandzeni who was motherless as her son, thus making him King and her the Queen mother of Swaziland.[3] His royal capital was at Mbekelweni. <br/>
Mbandzeni watsatsa bukhosi ngemuva kwekutsi umnakabo Ludvonga II ashone ngembi kokutsi abekwe njengeNkosi.[3] Kufa kwaluDvonga kwenta kutsi inkhosikati Lamgangeni atsatse Mbandzeni lobekete make amente indvodzana yakhe, loku ke ngiko lokwamenta waba yiNkosi.[3] Sigodlo sakhe besise Mbekelweni. <br/>
<hr/>
During his kingship Mbandzeni, granted many mining, farming, trading and administrative concessions to white settlers from Britain and the Transvaal. These concessions granted with the help of Offy sherpstone eventually led to the conventions of 1884 and 1894, which reduced the overall borders of Swaziland and later made Swaziland a protectorate of the South African Republic. <br/>
Emkhatsini wemnyaka wa 1884 kanye na 1894 Mbandzeni, waniketa emaNgisi ngemalungelo ukulima, kanye nekumba, waphindze waniketa ngemhlaba wase Ntilasifali (Transvaal) lomnyenti kakhulu. Lokuniketwa kwemihlaba (ngelusito lwa Offy sherpstone) Kwenta kutsi live laseSwatini libe lincane kakhulu. <br/>
<hr/>
Mbandzeni, still in command of a large Swazi army of more than 15000 men aided the British in defeating Sekhukhune in 1879 and preventing Zulu incursion into the Transvaal during the same year.[5] As a result, he guaranteed his country's independence and international recognition despite the Scramble for Africa which was taking place at the time. <br/>
Mbandzeni walekelela emangisi kutsi bancobe inkosi yemaPedia Sekhukhune ngo 1879 loku kwaphindze kwasita kutsi emaZulu angahlaseli indzawo yeNtilasifali.[5] Ngaloko ke live laseSwatini latimela njenge Sive. Mbandzeni wafa ngemnyaka wa 1889 . <br/>
<hr/>
Mbandzeni died after an illness in 1889 and is quoted to have said in his deathbed "the Swazi kingship dies with me".[6] [7] He was buried at the royal cemetery at Mbilaneni alongside his father and grandfather Sobhuza I. Mbandzeni was succeeded by his young son Mahlokohla and his wife Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli after a 5 year regency of Queen Tibati Nkambule.[6] Today a number of buildings and roads in Swaziland are named after Mbandzeni. Among these the Mbandzeni house in Mbabane and the Mbandzeni Highway to Siteki are named after him.[8] <br/>
Kantsi wakhuluma lamagama ngembi kokushona " Bukhosi BemaSwati bufa kanye nami".[6] [7] Wangcwatjwa emalibeni ebukhosi base Mbilaneni eceleni kwababe wakhe kanye namkhulu wakhe inkosi Sobhuza I. Mahlokohla walandzela ngemuva kwekufa kwaMbandzeni bakanye neNdlovukati Labotsibeni Mdluli batsatsa bukhosi ngemuva kweNdlovukati Tibati Nkambule.[6] Takhiwo letinyenti kanye nemigwaco ibitwa nga Mbandzeni.

The mountains lie on the eastern edge of the Kaapvaal Craton. The range is best known for having some of the oldest exposed rocks on Earth, estimated to be between 3.2 and 3.6 billion years (Ga) old, dating from the Paleoarchean.[1] The mountain range's extreme age and exceptional preservation have yielded some of the oldest undisputed signs of life on Earth and provide insight into the hostile nature of the Precambrian environment under which this life evolved.[3][4] This has led to the area being otherwise known as the "Genesis of life".[5] <br/>

The Komati River (also called Incomati River) is a river in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. <br/>
Umfula e-Komati watiwa ngekutsi Incomati,lona ngumfula lose South Africa, Swaziland kanye nase Mozambique. <br/>
<hr/>
It is 480 kilometres (298 mi) long, with a drainage basin 50,000 square kilometres (19,300 sq mi) in size. <br/>
Budze balomfula bungu 480 wemakhilomitha, kanye nesimunyo semanti lesinganga 50,000 wetikwele temakhilomitha. <br/>
<hr/>
Its mean annual discharge is 111 m3/s (3,920 cfs) at its mouth.[1] The name Komati is derived from inkomati (siSwati), meaning "cow", as its perennial nature is compared to a cow that always has milk.[2] <br/>
Lesimunyo sikhulula emanti langanga 111 wemamitha ngelisekhendi emlonyeni waso.[1]Leligama lelitsi Komati lisukela egameni lenkhomo lensikati lekhicita lubisi, lenkhomo kutsiwa Inkomati.[2] <br/>
<hr/>
The river originates west of Carolina, rising at an elevation of about 1,800 m (5,906 ft) near Breyten in the Ermelo district of the Mpumalanga province.[3] It flows in a general northeasterly direction and reaches the Indian Ocean at Maputo Bay, after a course of some 480 km (298 mi). <br/>
Lomfula usukela e-Carolina, akhuphukele nga 1500 wemamitha celeni kwase Breyten i-Ermelo, Mpumalanga. Agelete lomfula aye ngase lwandle lwemandiya i-Maputo Bay ngekucedza kuhamba emakhilomitha langanga 480.Bese kuba nalomunye umfula lokutsiwa i-Komati Gorge longetulu kwemfula we Nkomati kantsi futsi kulapho kuhlala khona tilwane letinjenge tinyoni. <br/>
<hr/>
The Komati Gorge is situated in the upper reaches of the Komati River and is the habitat of some endangered species such as the southern bald ibis.[4] In 2001 the 115 m high wall of the Maguga Dam was completed south of Piggs Peak, Swaziland, 26°4′51.57″S 31°15′25.84″E﻿ / ﻿26.0809917°S 31.2571778°E﻿ / -26.0809917; 31.2571778. <br/>
Emnyakeni wa 2001 libondza lelikhulu lelidamu lase Maguga lelingemamitha langu 115 kuya etulu lacedzwa e-Piggs Peak, eswatini. , 26°4′51.57″S 31°15′25.84″E﻿ / ﻿26.0809917°S 31.2571778°E﻿ / -26.0809917; 31.2571778. <br/>

In its upper valley near Steynsdorp are goldfields, but the reefs consist almost entirely of low grade ore. <br/>
Etulu kwalomfula eceleni kwase Steynsdorp kunemhlaba wemagolide, kepha ngaphansi kwemanti kunematje emnotfo. <br/>
<hr/>
The river descends the Drakensberg by a pass 48 km (30 mi) south of Barberton, and is deflected northward at the eastern border of Swaziland, keeping a course parallel to the Lebombo mountains. <br/>
Lomfula wehla ngase Drakensburg ngemakhilomitha langanga 48 ngentansi kwe- Barberton, kantsi futsi uphindze welele ngase gedeni lase Mpumalanga lase Swatini. Uchubeke ngekucondza angene etintsabeni tase Lebombo. <br/>
<hr/>
Just west of 32°E and 25°25'S, near the town of Komatipoort, it is joined by the Crocodile River. <br/>
Ngasenyakatfo ngema digrizi langu 32 e-Mpumalanga phindze kube nema digrizi langu 25 e-Ningizimu eceleni kwelidolobha lase Komatipoti, uhlangana kanye nemfula we-Tingwenya. <br/>
<hr/>
The Crocodile tributary rises, as the Elands River, in the Bergendal (1,961 m) near the upper waters of the Komati, and flows eastwards across the highveld, being turned northward as it reaches the Drakensberg escarpment. <br/>
Lomfula lomkhulu wetingwenya uyaphakama lesikhatsi umfula i-Elands River lose Bergendel longu 1,961 wemamitha eceleni kwemanti lasetulu e-Komati, ugeletele ngase Mpumalanga ezingeni lelisetulu, abuye ajikele ngase Nshonalanga afikelele e- Drakensberg lapho kwehlela khona. <br/>
<hr/>
The fall to the lowveld is over 600 m in 48 km (30 mi), and across the 161 km (100 mi) wide country between the Drakensberg and the Lebombo there is a further fall of 900 m. <br/>
Kuwa kwase ndzaweni lephansi kunganga 600 wemamitha kanye nemakhilomitha langu 48 kantsi futsi kuwelele emkhatsini kwe Drakensberg kanye ne Lebombo, ngebudze lobunganga 161 wemakhilomitha, kantsi e-Lubombo uchubeke uwe nga 900 wemamitha. <br/>
<hr/>
Just over a kilometre below the junction of the Crocodile, the united stream, which from this point is also known as the Manhissa, passes to the coastal plain through a 190 m high cleft, high in the Lebombo known as Komatipoort, featuring some picturesque falls. <br/>
Emuva kwelikhilomitha ngaphansi kwesijomelelo semfula wetingwenya, lomfula watiwa ngekutsi i- Manhissa londlulela ekuhlanganeni kwemhlaba kanye nemanti, ngebudze lobunganga 190 ngemamitha intsatjana, etulu kwe Lebombo lowatiwa nge- Komatipoti, kufaka ekhatsi umfula we picturesque. <br/>
<hr/>
At Komatipoort, which marks the border between South Africa and Mozambique, the river is less than 100 km (60 mi) from its mouth in a direct line, but in crossing the plain it makes a wide sweep of 322 km (200 mi), first northwards before turning southwards, forming lagoon-like expanses and backwaters and receiving from the north several tributaries. <br/>
I- Komatipoti lehlukanisa emave lamabili, lomfula ungaphansi kwemakhilomitha langu 100 kusukela emlonyeni emgceni locondzile, kepha esiphambanweni lomfula wenta bunwebeka ba 322 wemakhilomitha ekucaleni kwe kwenshonalanga kwehlela ngase ningizimu, kwakheka umsele kanye nemanti labuyela emuva. Futsi atfola emanti laphuma ngase nshonalanga ngalobunye bukhulu. <br/>
<hr/>
In flood time there is a connection northward through the swamps with the basin of the Limpopo. <br/>
Ngesikhatsi sesikhukhulo semanti kuba neluchumano lase nshonalanga kanye nemifula yase Liompopo. <br/>
<hr/>
The Komati enters the sea 24 km (15 mi) north of Maputo. <br/>
Umfula i-Komati ungena elwandle ngemakhilomitha langanga 24 enshonalanga yase Maputo. <br/>
<hr/>
It is navigable from its mouth, where the water is up to 5m deep, to the foot of the Lebombo. <br/>
Uyalandzeleleka kusukekela emlonyeni lapho emanti angemamitha langu lasihlanu ngekushona, kuze kuyofikela enyaweni lase Lebombo. <br/>
<hr/>
The Portuguese named the river's lower reaches the Rio des Reijs, or "river of rice". Subsequently Jan van Riebeeck's journal mentions a Rio de Reijs, when he dispatched a ship up the east coast in search of rice supplies.[5] In voortrekker Louis Tregardt's journal it is referred to as the Manhissa,[6] a name still extant, while to the British it was known as the King George River.[7] <br/>
Emaputukezi etsa ematje angaphansi atsi e-Rio des Reijs, noma emanti elayisi.Libhuku la Jan van RIEbeeke liyasho kutsi wakhuluma leligama i-Rio de Reijis lesikhatsi akhuluma nemkhumbi empumalanga ayofuna ilayisi. Enzaweni yase Voortrekker, incwadzi noma libhuku la Louis Tregardt litsi lendzawo i-Manhissa,[6] ligama lelisaphila, kepha kubelungu be British batsi kuse King George River. .[7] <br/>
<hr/>
In 1725 a Dutch expedition led by Francois de Kuiper explored the region of the lower Komati and travelled 30km into the current Mpumalanga province, before they were attacked by local tribes and had to return to Delagoa Bay. <br/>
Negmnyaka wa 1725, luhambo lwema Dutch lalihholwa ngu-Francois de Kuiper lebebayohlola lomfula i- Komati phindze bahamba emakhilomitha langu 30 bavakashela i-Mpumalanga, ngaphambi kwekutsi bahlaselwe bantfu balendzawo, baphoceleka kutsi babuyele e-Delagoa Bay. <br/>
<hr/>
On the September 23, 1900 during the Second Boer War, 3,000 Boers crossed the frontier at the small town of Komati Poort, and surrendered to the Portuguese authorities. <br/>
Ngelilanga le-Nyoni mhlaka 23 emnyaken wa 1900 lesikhatsi kunemphi ye-Second Boer War, emabhunu langu 3,000 ewela edolobheni lase Komatipoti, atinikrla emaphoyiseni ema Portuguese. <br/>
<hr/>
On November 7, 1900 the banks of the Komati became the site of a battle between the British Empire and the Boers. <br/>
Elangeni la 7 November 1900, emabhange ase Komati aba yindzawo yemphi yema British kanye nemabhunu. <br/>
<hr/>
The Battle of Leliefontein was a retreat by the British, harassed by the Boers, who were threatening to capture the British Artillery. <br/>
Imphi yase Leliefontein yayekelwa ma- British, bahlushwa ngemabhunu , emabhunu lasongela kubamba e- British Artillery. <br/>
<hr/>
The British guns were saved by the Royal Canadian Dragoons who charged the Boers, whereby they placed the guns out of their reach. <br/>
Tikhali tema British tasindziswa bukhosi base Canadian Dragons labahlawulisa emabhunu, babeka tikhali lapho bangeke bafikelele khona.. <br/>
<hr/>
The railway from Maputo to Pretoria traverses the plain in a direct line, and at seventy-two kilometres, reaches the Komati. It follows the south bank of the river and enters the high country at Komati Poort. <br/>
Umgwaco losuka e-Maputo aye e-Pretoria uhamba ngekucondza, ngemakhilomitha langu 72, afikele e-Komati. ulandzela umfula we libhange lase ningizimu ungenele eveni lelisetulu e- Komatipoti. <br/>
<hr/>
From the Poort westward the railway skirts the south bank of the Crocodile River throughout its length. This railway was originally constructed by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) and was officially inaugurated in 1895. <br/>
Usuke lapho ushine ngase nyakatfo aye emfuleni wetingwenya, ngebudze bakhona. lomgwaco wakhiwa inkapani lokutsiwa i- Netherlands- South Africa (NZASM), wavulwa emnyakeni wa 1895. <br/>
