Muhammad[n 1] (Arabic: مُحَمَّد‎, pronounced [muħamːad];[n 2] Monday, c. 570 CE – Monday, 8 June 632 CE)[1] was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of Islam.[2] According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, sent to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.[2][3][4][5] He is believed to be the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam, though some modern denominations diverge from this belief.[n 3] Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. <br/>
