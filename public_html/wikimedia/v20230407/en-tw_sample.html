U.S. Senator Jake Garn claimed to be able to see the Great Wall with the naked eye from a space shuttle orbit in the early 1980s, but his claim has been disputed by several U.S. astronauts. Veteran U.S. astronaut Gene Cernan has stated: "At Earth orbit of 100 to 200 miles [160 to 320 km] high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye." Ed Lu, Expedition 7 Science Officer aboard the International Space Station, adds that, "it's less visible than a lot of other objects. <br/>

Kente, known as nwentom in Akan, is a type of silk and cotton fabric made of interwoven cloth strips and is native to the Akan ethnic group of West Ghana. <br/>
Nnwentom y3 din a w)de fr3 kente w) Akanfo nkurow mu. Wonya kente yi fi "silk" ne asaawafuturu berea w)n anwene ntoma no nteatea de abomu ama no ay3 k3se mua. <br/>
<hr/>
Kente is made in Akan lands such as Ashanti Kingdom, (Bonwire, Adanwomase, Sakora Wonoo, Ntonso in the Kwabre areas of the Ashanti Region) It is also worn by the south eastern, central, and a part of the northern people of Ghana. <br/>
Akanfo nkurow ahorow a w)w) Ghana, West Africa no edi kente ho dwuma paa. Saa nkurow no bi ne Asanteman( Bonwire, Adanwomase, Sakora Wonoo ne Ntonso. Saa nkurow yi nyinaa w) Asanteman nkurow k3se baako a 3de Kwabre). <br/>
<hr/>
Kente comes from the word kenten, which means basket in Akan dialect Asante. <br/>
Nnipa a w)w) Anafo- Apue, Mfinimfini me Atifi mantam nso fura kente . <br/>
<hr/>
Akans refer to kente as nwentoma, meaning woven cloth. <br/>
Edin kente no fi asemfua kenten w) Asante kasa mu. <br/>
<hr/>
It is an Akan royal and sacred cloth worn only in times of extreme importance and was the cloth of kings. Over time, the use of kente became more widespread. <br/>
Akanfo fr3 kente nwentoma a ase kyer3 s3 ntoma a w)n anwene . Kan no, na 3y3 Akanfo ahenfo ntoma a na ahenfo no fura no dap)n nna nkotoo afei nso na wonni ho agoru koraa. <br/>
<hr/>
However, its importance has remained and it is held in high esteem with Akans. <br/>
Nanso mmere kakra yi de, nnipa pii fura kente a wonni ho agoru koraa de nnidi a 3s3 ma ntoma no. <br/>
<hr/>
Kente characterized by weft designs woven into every available block of plain weave is called adweneasa. <br/>
Adweneasa ka kente ntoma ahorow no bi. Ne nnwene no y3 soronko efis3 w)to w)nbo hyehy3 nhoma no yie de hy3 kwan biara aka ne nwene no mu. <br/>
<hr/>
The Akan people choose kente cloths as much for their names as their colors and patterns. <br/>
Akanfo p3 kente a, w)hwehw3 no fi din a 3daso titiriw ansa na w)nahw3 s3 3y3 tumtum, k)k)) anaa fitaa ansa na s3nea ne nwene no te. <br/>
<hr/>
Although the cloths are identified primarily by the patterns found in the lengthwise (warp) threads, there is often little correlation between appearance and name. <br/>
Mp3n pii no, kente hu mu gyina "pattern" a 3da mu w) ne tenten nwene no mu nanso 3y3 a , nsonsonoe ketewa bi na 3da kente no din ne ne nwenebea mu. <br/>
<hr/>
Names are derived from several sources, including proverbs, historical events, important chiefs, queen mothers, and plants.The cloth symbolizes high in value. <br/>
Akwan ahorow a w)nya din de to kente so no bi fi kasakoa, nne3ma titiriw bi a 3si, ahenfo atitiriw, ahenfo maame ne nnua mu. Ne saa nti, ntoma no gyina h) ma ade a , edi mu. <br/>
<hr/>
West Africa has had a cloth weaving culture for centuries via the stripweave method, but Akan history tells of the cloth being created independent of outsider influence. <br/>
"West Africafo" dii kan nyaa w)n ntoma nwene kwan mmere pii a atwam. Na w)nwene fa "strip weave" kwan so. Nanso, Akanfo abak)s3m kyer3 s3, w)n de, w)hy33, ase nwene w)ankasa ntoma a obiara anfi baabi ankyer3 w)n s3nea w) nwene ntoma. <br/>
<hr/>
Kente cloth has its origin from the Akan-Ashanti kingdoms in Ghana. <br/>
Kente ntoma ahy3ase fi Akan-Asanteman mu w) Ghana. <br/>
<hr/>
The origin of kente is in the Akan empire of Bonoman. <br/>
Kente ntoma nwene fii ase w) Akanfo tete )man k3se Bonoman. <br/>
<hr/>
Most Akans migrated out of the area that was Bonoman to create various states.[1] The Ewe people of Ghana think the weaving of Kente originates with them, although they are not claiming they invented the art of weaving. <br/>
Akanfo ahorow a w) fii Bonoman no k) kyekyee w)n nkurow nketekete. Ayigbefo a 3w) )man Ghana mu gyidi s3 kente hy33 ase fii w)n h) na 3mmom akwan a w)fa so nwene ade mfitiase de ennfi w)n h). <br/>
<hr/>
They suggest that the name is derived from Kete which relates to the two alternating rhythmic actions (ke and te, meaning open and press in the Ewe language) associated with the weaving of the loom. <br/>
Ayigbefo yi san kase edin "Kente" no fi asemfua "Kete" a , asekyer3 ( bue ne mia ) w) w)n kasa mu s3nea w)nwene kente w) ne dua so no. <br/>
<hr/>
Legend has it that kente was first made by two Akan friends who went hunting in an Asanteman forest found a spider making its web.[5] The friends stood and watched the spider for two days then returned home and implemented what they had seen. <br/>
Abak)s3m kyer3 s3, kente nwene hy33 ase berea nnamfo mmienu bi k)huu ananse w) w)n ahay) w) nnwura mu a na )renwene ne dan. Nnamfo mmienu yi hw33 na afei nso sua a nea na ananse no rey3 no nna mmienu. Woduu fie no, wofii ase nwene nea wohuu s3 ananse no rey3 no. <br/>
<hr/>
Kente academic stoles are often used by African Americans as a symbol of ethnic pride.[6][7][8] This practice is also very popular with historically black Greek letter fraternities and sororities. African American students hold special ceremonies called "Donning of the Kente" where the stoles are presented to the graduates. <br/>
