<hr/>
Although the books are designed to entertain young children, they are not intended as "early readers", as are, for example, the "Cat in the Hat" books by Doctor Seuss which have a very basic and largely phonic vocabulary. <br/>
Ahakoa i hangaia nga pukapuka hei whakangahau i nga tamariki nohinohi, kaore i te kii hei "panui panui", pera me te tauira, nga pukapuka " Cat in the Hat " na Doctor Seuss e whai kiko ana me te nuinga o te waahanga kupu. <br/>
<hr/>
The Hairy Maclary books, despite their simple stories, introduce the listening child to some long but very expressive words, which are not part of the average pre-schooler vocabulary but must be understood by the child in the context in which they occur. <br/>
Ko nga pukapuka a Hairy Maclary, ahakoa o a raatau korero ngawari, ka whakauru i te tamaiti whakarongo ki etahi kupu roa engari ki te tino whakapuaki, kaore nei i uru atu ki nga momo kupu a-kura-a-kura engari e maarama ana te tamaiti ki te horopaki e tupu ana ra. <br/>
<hr/>
For example, the noise made by a stranded cat and the excited dogs who discover it is described as a "cacophony". <br/>
Hei tauira, ko te haruru i hangaia e te ngeru puhipuhi me nga kuri koa e harikoa ana ka kitea he "cacophony". <br/>

Lynley Dodd's illustrations are closely observed from life. <br/>
Ko nga pikitia a Lynley Dodd e tino kitea ana mai i te koiora. <br/>
<hr/>
The breeds of dogs, the types of houses and the plants growing in each garden can generally be identified. <br/>
Ko nga momo o nga kuri, nga momo whare me nga tipu e tipu ana i ia kari ka taea te tautuhi. <br/>
<hr/>
The stories seem to exist in a real suburb in the real world. <br/>
Ko nga korero nei kei te noho i te kaainga tino i roto i te ao mau. <br/>
<hr/>
Hairy Maclary's home, for example, has a red corrugated iron roof supported on wooden brackets, and the garden has a frangipani tree, a picket fence and a row of agapanthi. <br/>
Ko te whare o Hairy Maclary, hei tauira, he tuanui rino whero kua tautokohia ki nga kurupae rakau, a ko te kari he rakau frangipani, he papa piketiki me te rarangi agapanthi . <br/>
<hr/>
Each picture promotes investigation and discussion between the child and the reader, as events unfold in the pictures which are not described in the text. <br/>
Ko ia pikitia e whakatairanga ana i te tirotiro me te korerorero i waenga i te tamaiti me te kaipanui, i te mea e whakaatu ana nga kaupapa kaore i te whakaahuahia i roto i nga tuhinga. <br/>
<hr/>
In the first book of the series the repeated lines "...and Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy" accompany a series of illustrations showing Hairy Maclary sniffing the bottom of a lamp-post, burrowing into a hedge, barking at some birds and raiding a garbage can. <br/>
I roto i te pukapuka tuatahi o nga raupapa nga raina korero "... me Hairy Maclary mai i te Kaipoirangi a Donaldson" e haere tahi ana i nga whakaahuatanga e whakaatu ana i a Hairy Maclary e hongi ana i raro o te rama-rama, e eke ana ki te pahere, ka haere ki etahi manu me te patu manu ka taea e te raihi. <br/>
<hr/>
Close observation is encouraged by the inclusion in many of the pictures of a tiny glimpse of the dog who has been named on the previous page, as it approaches or walks out of the picture, showing only the point of a nose or the tip of a tail. <br/>
Ko te tirohanga tata e akiaki ana i te whakauru ki roto i te maha o nga whakaahua o te kuri iti nei o te kuri i tapaina ki te wharangi o mua, i te mea e haere ana, e haere ana ranei i waho o te pikitia, e whakaatu ana i te rae noa o te ihu, te matamata ranei o te hiku. <br/>
