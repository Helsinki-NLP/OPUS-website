Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990)[1] is an English actress, model and activist. Born in Paris and brought up in Oxfordshire, Watson attended the Dragon School and trained as an actress at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. As a child, she rose to prominence with her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, having acted only in school plays previously. <br/>

<hr/>
The English poet Christopher Smart (1722–1771) was confined to mental asylums from May 1757 until January 1763. <br/>
Say ingles a managsulat Christopher Smart (1722–1771) sikatoy nipriso ed mental asylum manlupud Mayo 1757 anggad Enero 1763. <br/>
<hr/>
Smart was admitted to St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics, Upper Moorfields, London, on 6 May 1757. <br/>
Si Smart so inawat ed St. Luke's Hospital for Lunatics, Upper Moorfields, London, nen 6 Mayo 1757. <br/>
<hr/>
He was taken there by his father-in-law, John Newbery, although he may have been confined in a private madhouse before then. <br/>
Sikatoy inawit diman na katulangan ton si John Newbery, anggaman nayarin sikatoy nipriso ed sakey a pribadon ospital parad saray buang. <br/>
<hr/>
While in St Luke's he wrote Jubilate Agno and A Song to David, the poems considered to be his greatest works. <br/>
Legan a walad St. Luke's et insulat to so Jubilate Agno tan A Song to David, saray anlong ya ipapasen a sankamaongan a gawa to. <br/>
<hr/>
Although many of his contemporaries agreed that Smart was "mad", accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied, and some felt that he had been committed unfairly. <br/>
Anggaman dakel ed saray kapanaonan to so mipakna a si Smart et "sintinsiaan", nanduruma iray salaysay nipaakar ed kipapasen to tan saray nansumpalan na satan, tan walaray maniisip a sikatoy agmatunong. <br/>
<hr/>
Smart was diagnosed as "incurable" while at St Luke's, and when they ran out of funds for his care he was moved to Mr. Potter's asylum, Bethnal Green. <br/>
Si Smart et "agnasarag a paabigen" legan a walad St. Luke, tan sanen naupot so pundo parad pangasikaso ed sikato et inyalis ed Mr. Say asylum nen Potter, Bethnal Green. <br/>
<hr/>
All that is known of his years of confinement is that he wrote poetry. <br/>
Say amta tayo labat nipaakar ed impanpriso to et sikatoy nansulat na anlong. <br/>
<hr/>
Smart's isolation led him to abandon the poetic genres of the 18th century that had marked his earlier work and to write religious poetry such as Jubilate Agno ("Rejoice in the Lamb"). <br/>
Say inka-isolado nen Smart so amakiwas ed sikaton ikaindan iray anlong na anlong nen koma-18 a siglo a nankabaliksan na apalabas a kimey to tan mansulat na relihyoson anlong a singa say Jubilate Agno ("Manliket ed Kordero"). <br/>
<hr/>
His asylum poetry reveals a desire for "unmediated revelation", and it is possible that the self-evaluation found in his poetry represents an expression of evangelical Christianity. <br/>
Ipapanengneng na saray anlong to a labay ton "naliktar a tampol", tan posiblin say panag-usisa ed sarili ya walad saray anlong to et pakapatnagan na ebanghelisyal a Inkakristiano. <br/>
<hr/>
Late 18th-century critics felt that Smart's madness justified them in ignoring his A Song to David, but during the following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition to be the source of his genius. <br/>
Saray kritiko ed bandad sampot na koma-18 a siglo et inisip dan say inkabulok nen Smart so angiter ed sikara na rason pian ibaliwala so A Song to David to, balet diad tinmumbok a siglo et inisip nen Robert Browning tan saray kapanaon to ya say kipapasen to so lapuan na inkasilib to. <br/>
<hr/>
It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him. <br/>
Diad koma-20 a siglo, sanen adiskobre lamet so Jubilate Agno (agni nipalapag anggad 1939), saray kritiko et ninonot da lamet so kaso nen Smart tan sikatoy impasen dan sakey a rebolusyonaryo a managsulat, say posiblin puntirya na plano na katulangan to, sakey ya publisher, pian sikato so patundaen. <br/>
