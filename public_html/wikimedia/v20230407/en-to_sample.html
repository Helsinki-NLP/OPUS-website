Asia (i/ˈeɪʒə, ˈeɪʃə/) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population[3][not in citation given], was the site of many of the first civilizations. <br/>

Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. <br/>
Ko e hulohula ko ha foomu ngaue 'oku fakahoko 'i he founga 'oku fili ai 'a e fa'ahinga 'o e tangata. <br/>
<hr/>
This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. <br/>

Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years[14] prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day. <br/>

<hr/>
The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. <br/>
Ko e fonua lahi taha ia ʻi ʻOusenia mo e fonua lahi taha hono ono ʻo e mamani ʻi he feituʻu fakakatoa. ʻOku urbanised lahi ʻa e tokolahi ʻo e 26 million pea ʻoku fakatefito ia ʻi he ngaahi feituʻu fakahahake. <br/>
<hr/>
On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. <br/>
Ko e kolomuʻa ʻo ʻAositelelia ko Canberra, pea ko hono kolo lahi taha ko Senee. <br/>
<hr/>
Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. <br/>

Terra Australis still saw occasional usage, such as in scientific texts.[N 6] The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who said it was "more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth".[38] Several famous early cartographers also made use of the word Australia on maps. <br/>
