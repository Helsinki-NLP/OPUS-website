The World Medical Association (WMA) is an international and independent confederation of free professional medical associations, therefore representing physicians worldwide. WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947[1] and has grown in 2017 to 114 national medical associations[2] [3] and more than 10 million physicians. <br/>

The WMA provides a forum for its member associations to communicate freely, to co-operate actively, to achieve consensus on high standards of medical ethics and professional competence and to promote the professional freedom of physicians worldwide. With this unique partnership, WMA aims to facilitate high-caliber, humane care to patients in a healthy environment, enhancing the quality of life for all people in the world. <br/>

The WMA was founded on 18 September 1947, when physicians from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins", which had suspended its activities because of World War II.[1] <br/>
Irishyirahamwe cg umuryango (WMA) washinzwe ku wa 18 Nzeri 1947, Ubwo abaganga bo mu bihugu 27 bitandukanye bahuye bwa mbere mu nama rusange y'iri shyirahamwe i Paris. uy' umuryango wubatswe hagendeye ku gitekerezo cy'umuryango w'abaganga w'abongereza mu 1945 , mu nama yabereye i London kugirango hatangizwe umuryango mpuzamahanga w'abaganga wazaga gusimbura ishyirahamwe ry'abanyamwuga mpuzamahanga b'abaganga ryari ryahagaritse imirimo yaryo bitewe n'intambara y'isi yose II.[1] <br/>
<hr/>
In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France. <br/>
Mu buryo bwo koroshya ubufasha bw'amafaranga buturuka mu b'anyamuryango , mu 1948 , inteko nyobozi yatangije ubunyamabanga bwa WMA mu mujyi wa New York mu buryo bwo koroshya imikoranire n'umuryango wabibumbye ndetse n'ibindi bigo b'iwushamikiyeho. ubunyamabanga bw'iri shyirahamwe WMA bwagumye New york kugeza mu 1974 igihe ku mpamvu z'umutungo no kugirango bakorere hafi ya Geneve nk'umujyi uzwiho kugira imiryango mpuzamahanga myinshi yigenga (WHO,ILO,ICN,ISSA,etc.) bwavuye aho bwari bujyanwa mu bufaransa ahitwa Ferney-voltaire. <br/>
<hr/>
The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named "World Medical Assembly." <br/>
Abanyamuryango bahuraga mu nama y'umwaka ariyo yaje kwitwa "World Medical Assembly" Inama Rusange 1962. <br/>
<hr/>
Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, taking the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world physicians. A modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the "Declaration of Geneva." <br/>
Kuva Muntangiriro WMA yagaragaje kwita cyane k'ubuvuzi bunoze muri rusange ndetse no ku isi yose , ikaba nyambere mugushyiraho amabwiriza anoze ku baganga bose bo ku isi. n'isesengura ry'amagambo ari mu ndahiro ya Hippocrates ryaje kwemerwa mu nama rusange ya II mu 1948 i Geneva . inteko rusange yemeje iyo ndahiro ivuguruye bayita "inyandiko y'i Geneve." <br/>
<hr/>
Also in the same II General Assembly a report on "War Crimes and Medicine" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly. <br/>
Nanone mu nama rusange ya II raporo ku "ibyaha by'intamabara n'ubuvuzi" yarakiriwe. ibi byateye inteko gushyiraho akanama kiga kandi kagategura amabwiriza y'ubuvuzi mpuzamahanga ngenderwaho akaba yaraje kwemerwa nyuma yo kuyemeranyaho mu nama rusange III mu 1949. <br/>
<hr/>
Even after the adoption of these two documents, WMA was constantly being informed about violations of medical ethics, crimes committed by doctors in time of war, unethical human experimentation, among several other problems in the field of medical ethics and medical law. This information caused the Council to establish a permanent Committee on Medical Ethics in 1952, which has been working actively ever since, as one can see from the declarations or statements of the WMA and their continuous updates. <br/>
Na Nyuma yo kwemeza izi nyandiko ebyiri , WMA yakomeje guhabwa amakuru yo kutubahiriza amabwiriza agenga ubuvuzi, ibyaha byakozwe n'abaganga mu bihe by'intambara, kwigira cg gukorera ubushakashatsi ku bantu mu buryo butemewe n'ibindi bibazo bijyanye no kutubahiriza amabwiriza ndetse n;'amategeko agenga umwuga w'ubuvuzi. ibi byateye inteko gushyiraho akanama gahoraho ku bijyanye n'amabwiriza agenga ubuvuzi mu 1952, akanama ariko kakomeje no gukora kuva icyo gihe nkuko ushobora kubibona mu nyandiko z'ishyirahamwe WMA n'amakuru yayo agezweho. <br/>
<hr/>
The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA). <br/>
Ni rwo rwego rukuru rufata ibyemezo muri iri shyirahamwe WMA ruhura buri mwaka rugizwe n'abanyamuryango baturutse mu bihugu binyamuryango nabagize ururgaga, abofosiye n'abahagarariye abanyamuryango bigenga (associate members). <br/>
<hr/>
The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. <br/>
Inteko nkuru itora buri mwaya ibiri abagie urugaga baturutse mu turere dutandatu tugize umuryango ku isi ari twoː Afurika, Asiya, Uburayi, Amerika y'abalatino, Amerika y'amajyaruguru na Pasifika. iteko rusange kandi itora umuyobozi (President) buri mwaka, ari we uhagararira umuryango mu nama n'ibirori. <br/>

Umuyobozi utowe nuvuyeho bakora kuburyo ubonetse ariwe uhagararira umuryango. <br/>

Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization. As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council. <br/>
