<hr/>
The airfield was used during World War II by the RAF and other Allied Forces to counter Indian Freedom Fighters led by Subhas Chandra Bose.[citation needed] After India gained Independence from Allied Forces, the airfield was abandoned. In 2008, AAI carried out a feasibility study to revive Jharsuguda airport, which, by then was occasionally used by General Aviation aircraft and was unfit for commercial operations.[5] Air Odisha launched non-scheduled commercial flights between Rourkela, Jharsuguda and Bhubaneswar on 2 November 2012. <br/>
