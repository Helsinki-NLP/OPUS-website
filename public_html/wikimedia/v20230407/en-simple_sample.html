The term coffin ships is used to refer to the ships that carried Irish immigrants escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Highlanders displaced by the Highland Clearances.[1] These ships, crowded and disease-ridden, with poor access to food and water, resulted in the deaths of many people as they crossed the Atlantic, and led to the Typhus epidemic of 1847 at quarantine stations in Canada.[2] Owners of coffin ships provided as little food, water, and living space as was legally possible – if they obeyed the law at all. <br/>
Coffin ships transported Irish immigrants to America during the Great Irish Famine (1845-1852). They were the cheapest way to cross the Atlantic but it was a miserable and dangerous journey. The conditions on board were horrible because the ships were so crowded. <br/>
<hr/>
While coffin ships were the cheapest way to cross the Atlantic, mortality rates of 30% aboard the coffin ships were common.[3] It was said that sharks could be seen following the ships, because so many bodies were thrown overboard.[4][5][6] <br/>
One third (30%) of the passengers died before the arrival in Canada or the USA. Legend says sharks liked to follow coffin ships because the crew threw the dead bodies overboard. <br/>

History <br/>
Brief History <br/>
<hr/>
Nan Chiau High School was founded as Nan Chiau Teachers' Training School in 1941 by Chinese businessman, community leader and philanthropist Mr Tan Kah Kee. Its first campus was built on a plot of land donated by Lee Kong Chian, at Kim Yam Road in River Valley. <br/>
Nan Chiau High School was originally Nan Chiau Teachers' Training School which started in 1941 by Tan Kah Kee, at Kim Yam Road in River Valley. <br/>
<hr/>
In early 1942, the campus was used as the headquarters and training grounds for Dalforce, a Chinese volunteers’ army that was formed immediately before the overland attack of the Japanese army.[7] <br/>
During World War II, the school was used as the headquarters and training grounds for Dalforce, against the invading Japanese.[7] <br/>
<hr/>
In 1947 Nan Chiau Teachers' Training School was converted by Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan into Nan Chiau Girls' High School, featuring a primary school section. <br/>
In 1947 Nan Chiau Teachers' Training School was changed into Nan Chiau Girls' High School. <br/>
<hr/>
Mr Yang Zhen Li was the first Principal of the institution, with an initial student enrolment of 900.[8] A female hostel was also built in the 1950s.[9] In 1965, Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan spent $2 million rebuilding Nan Chiau Girl's High School. <br/>

<hr/>
During the construction, the high school section moved to temporary premises at Guillemard Road, while the primary school section remained at the original site. The new premises was declared open by Mr. Ong Pang Boon, Minister for Education, on 8 March 1969.[10] <br/>
On 8 March 1969, the new premises was opened by then education minister Ong Pang Boon 8 March 1969. [10] <br/>
<hr/>
In 1974, there were a total student enrolment of 2692, the most number of students in the school’s history, with 48 secondary classes and 24 primary classes. To cope with the increased school population, another $300 000 was spent to add on a 5th storey to the school building.[11] <br/>
In 1974, the school was further expanded due to high number of students.[11] <br/>
<hr/>
In 1978, it was initially included in the list of newly established Special Assistance Plan Schools. <br/>
In 1980 the school became English medium school. In 1984, the school started to take in boys. <br/>
<hr/>
However, with the concern from the MOE that having too many SAP schools would affect the quality of students admitted, the number of SAP schools were amended to nine, which excluded Nan Chiau Girl's High School.[12] In 1980 it adopted English as its language medium. As student population declined, the school went co-educational in 1984 with the enrolment of male students, and was renamed "Nan Chiau High School"[13] <br/>
The school is renamed "Nan Chiau High School"[13] <br/>

In 2000, Nan Chiau High School relocated to Sengkang New Town under an agreement with the Singapore Land Authority. The primary section separated to form Nan Chiau Primary School and relocated to 50 Anchorvale Link.[14] That year, Nan Chiau High School was also ranked the top value-added school in the Ministry of Education's 1999 ranking of Special/Express schools in Singapore.[11] In November 2010, Nan Chiau High School was designated by MOE to become the 11th Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school from January 2012. The news was announced by then minister of education Dr Ng Eng Hen at the Hokkien Festival 2010.[15] The news was welcomed by thousands of school alumni and educators, who felt pleased that the school can finally fulfill its mission of preserving the Chinese heritage and culture.[16] <br/>

The muriquis, also known as woolly spider monkeys, are the monkeys of the genus Brachyteles.[1] They are closely related to both the spider monkeys and the woolly monkeys.[1] The two species are the southern (B. arachnoides) and northern muriqui (B. hypoxanthus) muriquis.[1] They are the two largest species of New World monkeys, and the northern species is one of the most endangered of all the world's monkeys.[2] They are found only in the Atlantic coast forests of southeastern Brazil at altitudes ranging from sea level to 1500 m (5000 ft). <br/>
The muriquis, also called woolly spider monkeys, make the genus Brachyteles.[1] [1]There are two kinds, the southern (B. arachnoides) and northern muriqui (B. hypoxanthus) muriquis.[1] They are the two largest New World monkeys. The northern muriqui is one of the most endangered monkeys in the world.[2] They are seen only in some forests in Brazil. <br/>
<hr/>
The adult muriqui is 15-23 inches (38–58 cm) long without its tail and weighs from 10-20 pounds (4.5-9 kilos) It ranges in coloration from brown to black and the underside of their prehensile tails has no fur at the end. <br/>
The adult muriqui is 15-23 inches (38–58 cm) long and weighs from 10-20 pounds (4.5-9 kilos) They are colored from brown to black and the bottom of their tails have no fur near the end. <br/>
<hr/>
Muriquis are folivores (leaf eaters), but will also eat significant amounts of fruit and flowers in the rainy season, as well as bark, bamboo, ferns, nectar, pollen, and seeds. <br/>
Muriquis eat mostly leaves. They sometimes eat fruit and flowers in the rainy season, as well as bark, bamboo, ferns, nectar, pollen, and seeds. <br/>
<hr/>
Observed group sizes range from four to 43, and can contain plentiful numbers of both males and females. <br/>
Muriquis live in groups from four to 43. <br/>
<hr/>
Muriquis are polygamous, and unlike many other primates, males spend large periods of time together without significant aggressive encounters. As such, they are also not territorial. <br/>
They do not fight about their territory. <br/>
<hr/>
The name "muriqui" comes from a native Tupi word meaning approximately 'largest monkey'. B. arachnoides is also known as mono carvoeiro, which translates to "charcoal monkey". <br/>

The family includes only a single genus, Dicamptodon. <br/>
The family has only one genus, Dicamptodon. <br/>
<hr/>
The genus was formerly thought to contain two species, Cope's giant salamander (D. copei) on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, and the Pacific giant salamander (D. ensatus) which consisted of three geographic populations, an Idaho isolate, a group in northern California, and a group in Oregon and Washington.[1] In 1989, genetic studies showed D. copei to be a distinct species, and the D. ensatus populations to consist of three species: the Idaho giant salamander (D. aterrimus) in Idaho, and two highly divergent species with a narrow hybrid zone in California, the coastal giant salamander (D. tenebrosus) (ranging from northern California to Washington), and the California giant salamander (D. ensatus) (limited only from Santa Cruz County to Mendocino County in California).[2] <br/>
The genus has four species, Cope's giant salamander (D. copei), the Idaho giant salamander (D. aterrimus), the coastal giant salamander (D. tenebrosus), and the California giant salamander (D. ensatus).[2] <br/>
<hr/>
Specimens are up to 30 cm (12 in) long, and are found in the western USA and southwestern British Columbia. <br/>
The salamanders may grow up to 30 cm (12 in) long, and are found in the western USA and southwestern British Columbia. <br/>
<hr/>
Except for their size, they are similar to the mole salamander family (Ambystomatidae), in which they were originally included.[3] <br/>
They are larger than the mole salamander family (Ambystomatidae) but like them other than their size.[3] <br/>
<hr/>
While most salamanders are silent, the Pacific giant salamander is one of several salamanders that have vocal abilities. When startled, these salamanders may respond with a croaky-sounding cry similar to that of a barking dog. <br/>
Most salamanders are silent but the Pacific giant salamander can make noise. <br/>
