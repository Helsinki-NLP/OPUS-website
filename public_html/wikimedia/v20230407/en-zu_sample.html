Adult education is a practice in which adults engage in systematic and sustained self–educating activities in order to gain new forms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values.[1] It can mean any form of learning adults engage in beyond traditional schooling, encompassing basic literacy to personal fulfillment as a lifelong learner.[2] In particular, adult education reflects a specific philosophy about learning and teaching based on the assumption that adults can and want to learn, that they are able and willing to take responsibility for that learning, and that the learning itself should respond to their needs.[3] Driven by what one needs or wants to learn, the available opportunities, and the manner in which one learns, adult learning is affected by demographics, globalization and technology.[4] The learning happens in many ways and in many contexts just as all adults' lives differ.[5] Adult learning can be in any of the three contexts, i.e. <br/>
Imfundo yabadala yinqubo lapho khona abantu abadala bengenela khona imisebenzi eqhubekayo yokuzifundisa ukuze bathole ulwazi olusha, amakhono, imibono noma ama-value.[1] Lokhu kuchaza noma yiyiphi imfundo abadala abayingenelayo ngaphandle kwesikole esivamile, okubandakanya umkhakha wokuqala ukufunda ukubhala komuntu okuyisisekelo noma ukuqhubeka nokufunda komfundi impilo yakhe yonke.[2] Ngokuqondane nalolu daba, imfundo yabadala ikhombisa ifilosofi eqondene nokuthize maqondana nokufunda kanye nokufundisa ngokulandela ukuthi abantu abadala bangakwazi ukufunda futhi bayafuna ukufunda, nokuthi ukufunda ngokwakho kumele kubhekane nezidingo zabo.[3] Ngokugqugquzelwa yilokho okudingwa ukufundwa ngumuntu noma umuntu afuna ukukufunda, amathuba akhona, kanye nendlela umuntu afunda ngayo, ukufunda komuntu omdala kubandakanywa yindlela isizwe esihleleke ngayo, njengobuningi babantu ezweni nobulili (demographic), ukuhlobana kwamazwe nezimakethe zamazwe omhlaba (globalisation), kanye netheknoloji.[4] Ukufunda kwenzeka ngezindlela ezehlukene futhi ngaphansi kwezimo ezehlukene njengoba nezimpilo zabantu abadala zehlukene.[5] Ukufunda kwabantu abadala kungenzeka ngaphansi kwezimo ezintathu, Isibonelo sazo nazi lapha ngezansi: <br/>
<hr/>
Formal – Structured learning that typically takes place in an education or training institution, usually with a set curriculum and carries credentials; Non-formal – Learning that is organized by educational institutions but non credential. <br/>
Formal – Ukufunda okuhleliwe okwenziwa ezikhungweni zemfundo noma zoqeqesho, ezivamise ukuba ne-curriculum ehleliwe kanti futhi lapho khona abantu abafundayo abathola izitifikedi ezibonisa ukuphasa abakufundile; Non-formal – Ukufunda okuhlelwa zikhungo zemfundo kodwa ezinganikezelwa izifikedi ezibonisa lokho abantu abakufundile. <br/>
<hr/>
Non-formal learning opportunities may be provided in the workplace and through the activities of civil society organizations and groups; Informal education – Learning that goes on all the time, resulting from daily life activities related to work, family, community or leisure (e.g. community baking class).[6][7] <br/>
Amathuba okufunda oku-Non-Formal kungenzeka emisebenzini noma kwenziwa zinhlangano zemiphakathi ezithize kanye namaqembu athize; Imfundo engahlelekile (Informal education) – Ukufunda okwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi, okwenzeka kuzo zonke izimo empilweni, emndenini, emiphakathini noma esikhathini sokuziphumulela nokungcebeleka (isibonelo, lapho kuneklasi lokubhaka emphakathini).[6][7] <br/>

Defined as the science and art of helping adults learn,[8][9] the practice of adult education is referred to as andragogy, to distinguish it from the traditional school-based education for children pedagogy. <br/>
Kuchazwa njengesayense nobuciko bokusiza abantu abadala ukufunda D,[8][9] iphrakthizi noma inqubo yemfundo yabadala ichazwa ngethemu elithi:andragogy (okuyisayense namathekniki okufundisa abantu abadala), ukwenza umehluko phakathi kwemfundo yesikole yezingane ebizwa ngokuthi yi-pedagogy (okuyithiyori yokufunda nokufundisa kwimfundo ehlelekile). <br/>
<hr/>
Unlike children, adults are seen as: <br/>
Umehluko phakathi kwezingane nabantu abadala, ukuthi abantu abadala bobonwa ngokulandelayo: <br/>
<hr/>
More self-directed, rather than relying on others for help Mature and therefore experienced with the experience providing a rich source for learning An Adult's readiness to learn is linked to what one needs to know Adult orientation to learn is problem centred rather than subject centered Adult motivation to learn is internal.[9] <br/>
Abantu abadala bayaziqhuba, abancikile kwabanye ukubasiza Abantu abadala bavuthiwe engqondweni, kanti banezipiliyoni kakhulu ezenza ukuthi babenomthombo ocebile wokufunda Ukuzimisela komuntu omdala ukufunda kuxhunyaniswa nalokho umuntu afuna ukukwazi Umqondo womuntu omdala wokufunda usekelwe phansi kwenkinga kunokuba usekelwe kwisihloko salokho okufundwayo (subject centered). Ugqozi lomuntu omdala lokufunda lungaphakathi kuye.[9] <br/>
<hr/>
Educating adults differs from educating children in several ways given that adults have accumulated knowledge and work experience which can add to the learning experience.[10] Another difference is that most adult education is voluntary, therefore, the participants are generally self-motivated, unless required to participate, by an employer, for example. <br/>
Ukufundisa abantu abadala kwehlukile kunokufundisa izingane ngezindlela ezehlukene, ngoba abantu abadala banolwazi abaluqokelele kanye nezipiliyoni zokusebenza, okungezela kwizipiliyoni zabo zokufunda.[10] Omunye umehluko, ukuthi imfundo yabadala yenziwa ngokuzithandela, ngakho-ke abababamba iqhaza kuyo bavamise ukuba nogqozi, ngaphandle kokuba bephoqelekile ukungenela leyo mfundo, isibonelo, mhlawumbe bephoqelelwa ngumqashi. <br/>
<hr/>
Adults frequently apply their knowledge in a practical fashion to learn effectively. <br/>
Abantu abadala bavamise ukusebenzisa ulwazi lwabo ngendlela ebambekayo ukuze bafunde ngokunomphumela. <br/>
<hr/>
They must have a reasonable expectation that the knowledge they gain will help them further their goals. <br/>
Kumele balindele ukuthi ulwazi abalutholayo luzobasiza ukuqhubela phambili izinhloso zabo. <br/>
<hr/>
For example, during the 1990s, many adults, including mostly office workers, enrolled in computer training courses. <br/>
Isibonelo, ngeminyaka yoma 1990, abantu abadala abaningi, ababandakanya abasebenzi basemahhovisi, bangenela amakhozi oqeqesho lwamakhompyutha. <br/>
<hr/>
These courses would teach basic use of the operating system or specific application software. <br/>
La makhozi ayefundisa ulwazi oluyisekelo sokuqala se-operating system noma oluqondene nokusebenza okuthile kwama-software. <br/>
<hr/>
Because the abstractions governing the user's interactions with a PC were so new, many people who had been working white-collar jobs for ten years or more eventually took such training courses, either at their own whim (to gain computer skills and thus earn higher pay) or at the behest of their managers. <br/>
Ngoba izincazelo eziningi noma ama-abstractions alawula ukusebenza noma ukusetshenziswa kwama-PC kwakusekusha kakhulu, ngakhoke abantu abaningi ababesebenza emahhovisi eminyakeni elishumi noma ngaphezulu kwayo kuleso sikhathi, baqala ukungenela izifundo zalolo qeqesho, ngokuzithandela ngokwabo (ukuthola amakhono amakhompyutha ukuze bahole imali yezinga eliphezulu) noma bangenela uqeqesho ngoba omininjele babo befuna ukuthi bangenele lolo qeqesho. <br/>
<hr/>
In the United States and many areas in Canada, a more general example is when adults who dropped out of high school return to school to complete general education requirements. <br/>
EMelika kanye nezindawo eziningi zase-Canada, isibonelo esivamile, yilapho kuba nesidingo sokuthi abantu abadala abayeka isikole bengaqedanga babuyele ezikoleni ukuyoqedelela imfundo yabo yesikole. <br/>
<hr/>
Most upwardly mobile positions require at the very least a high school diploma or equivalent. <br/>
Izikhundla eziningi eziphezulu zidinga ukuthi abantu babe nediploma yesikole semfundo ephezulu (high school) noma elinye izinga elilingana nayo. <br/>
<hr/>
A working adult is unlikely to have the freedom to simply quit his or her job and go "back to school" full-time. Public school systems and community colleges usually offer evening or weekend classes for this reason. <br/>
Umuntu omdala osebenzayo akavamile ukuba nenkululeko yokuthi avele ayeke umsebenzi wakhe ukuze abuyele esikoleni ayofunda ngokuphelele. Izikole zohulumeni noma amakholishi emiphakathi avamise ukuhlinzeka ngamaklasi abanjwa ngezimpelasonto ngenxa yalesi sizathu. <br/>
<hr/>
In Europe this is often referred to as "second-chance", and many schools offer tailor-made courses and learning programs for these returning learners. <br/>
EYuropha lokhu kuvamise ukubizwa ngokuthi "yithuba lesibili" kanti izikole eziningi zihlinzeka ngamakhozi ahlelelwe inhloso ethize ngolulandela izidingo kanye nezinhlelo zemfundo zalaba bafundi. <br/>
<hr/>
Furthermore, adults with poor reading skills can obtain help from volunteer literacy programs. <br/>
Kanti-ke futhi okunye, abantu abadala abanamakhono ezinga eliphansi lokufunda bangathola usizo kwizinhlelo zobuvolontiya zalaba bafundi ababuyela ukuyofunda. <br/>
<hr/>
These national organizations provide training, tutor certification, and accreditation for local volunteer programs. <br/>
Lezi zinhlangano zikazwelonke zihlinzeka ngoqeqesho, izitifikedi zokufunda, kanye nama-accreditation ezinhlelo zobuvoluntiya zendawo. <br/>
<hr/>
States often have organizations which provide field services for volunteer literacy programs. <br/>
EMelika, kuvamise ukuba nezinhlangano ezihlinzeka ngamasevisi emiphakathi kwizinhlelo zobuvolontiya zokufundisa abasaqalayo ukufunda. <br/>
<hr/>
Purposes of adult education may vary, the general purposes of which are summarized as: <br/>
Izinhloso zemfundo yabadala zingehluka, izinhloso ezivamile zingafinyezwa ngokulandelayo: <br/>
<hr/>
Vocational Social Recreational Self-development[11] <br/>
Vocational (ukufundela amakhono nolwazi oluthile ukuze ukwazi ukwenza umsebenzi othile) Social (amakhono aqondene nobudlelwane nabantu) Recreational (okuqondene nokungcebeleka nokuzijabulisa) Self-development (Amakhono okuzithuthukisa)[11] <br/>
<hr/>
One of its goals may be to help adult learners satisfy their personal needs and achieve their professional goals.[12] Therefore, its ultimate goal might be to achieve human fulfillment. <br/>
Enye yezinhloso kungaba ukusiza a bantu abadala ukufezekisa izidingo zabo ziqu kanye nokufinyelela izinhloso zezamaprofeshini.[12] Ngakho-ke, inhloso eyisiphetho yemfundo, kungaba ukufezekisa izinhloso zokuzenelisa kountu. <br/>
<hr/>
The goal might also be to achieve an institution's needs. <br/>
Inhloso ingaba ukufezekisa izidingo zesikhungo. <br/>
<hr/>
For example, this might include improving its operational effectiveness and productivity. <br/>
Isibonelo, lokhu kungabandakanya ukuthuthukisa ikhono lokwenza umsebenzi kanye nezinga lokukhiqiza endaweni yomsebenzi. <br/>
<hr/>
A larger scale goal of adult education may be the growth of society by enabling its citizens to keep up with societal change and maintain good social order.[1] <br/>
Inhloso ebanzi yemfundo yabadala kungaba kungaba ukukhula kwesizwe ngokwenza uuthhi izakhamizi ezindala zikwazi ukuba sezingeni nezinguquko ezenzekayo esizweni kanye nokuthi kuqhubeke kube nenqubo elungile esizweni.[1] <br/>
<hr/>
The purpose of adult education in the form of college or university is distinct. <br/>
Inhloso yemfundo yabadala emakholishi noma emayunivesithi yehlukile. <br/>
<hr/>
In these institutions, the aim is typically related to personal growth and development as well as occupation and career preparedness. <br/>
Kulezi zikhungo, inhloso ivamise ukuthi iqondane nentuthuko yomuntu siqu kanye nomsebenzi ofundelwayo kanye nokuba ngolungele umsebenzi othile ofundelwayo. <br/>
<hr/>
Another goal might be to not only sustain the democratic society, but to even challenge and improve its social structure.[1] <br/>
Enye inhloso kungaba ukuqondana nokufakela izinselele esizweni kanye nokuthuthukisa umumo esizwe, kungekhona nje kuphela ukuqhubela phambili isizwe senqubo yedimokhrasi.[1] <br/>
<hr/>
Another fast-growing sector of adult education is English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), also referred to as English as a Second Language (ESL) or English Language Learners (ELL).[13] These courses are key in assisting immigrants with not only the acquisition of the English language, but the acclimation process to the culture of the United States as well as other English speaking countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[14] <br/>
Omunye umkhakha okhula masishane wemfundo yabadala ukufundiswa kwe-English kubantu abangakhulumi lolu limi, okubizwa ngokuthi yi-Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), kanti futhi lezi zifundo zibuye zibizwe nangokuthi yi-English as a Second Language (ESL) noma i-English Language Learners (ELL).[13] La makhozi alezi zifundo asiza abantu abasuke bebuya kwamanye amazwe bengena kwamanye lapho okukhulunywa khona i-English, ukuthi bafunde i-English kanye nokuba nolwazi kanye nokujwayela amasiko alawo mazwe abangena kuwo, njengamazwe aseMelika kanye namanye amazwe okukhulunywa kuwo i-English, afana nase-Canada, e-Australia nase-New Zealand.[14] <br/>
<hr/>
A common problem in adult education in the US is the lack of professional development opportunities for adult educators. <br/>
Inkinga evamile e-US ukusweleka kwamathuba okuthuthuka ngezeprofeshini kubantu abafundisa abantu abadala. <br/>
<hr/>
Most adult educators come from other professions and are not well trained to deal with adult learning issues. <br/>
Abantu abaningi abafundisa abantu abadala baqhamuka kwamanye amaprofeshini kanti futhi abaqeqeshiwe kahle ukubhekana nezinto eziphathelene nokufunda kwabantu abadala. <br/>
<hr/>
Most of the positions available in this field are only part-time without any benefits or stability since they are usually funded by government grants that might last for only a couple of years. However, in Canada, professional development is available in all provinces and territories through postsecondary institutions and most Provinces also provide professional development through their ministry of education or school boards and through nongovernmental organizations.[15] In addition, there are programs about adult education for existing and aspiring practitioners offered, at various academic levels, by universities, colleges, and professional organizations.[16] <br/>
Izikhundla eziningi ezikhona kulo mkhakha zivamise ukuba ngezingezona izikkhundla zokwenza umsebenzi ngokugcwele (part-time) kanti futhi kulezo zikhundla abantu abatholi ama-benefit nokuba sezikhundleni ezinzile, ngoba zivamises ukuxhaswa ngezimali zamagranti kahulumeni kanti futhi le mixhaso kahulumeni ayivamile ukuba ngeqhubeka ngaso sonke isikhathi, ivamise ukuba ngeminyakana ethize. Kodwa e-Canada, ukuthuthuka ngezeprofeshini kuyatholakala kuwo wonke amaprovinsi kanye nezindawo, ezikhungweni ezingaphezulu kwe kwemfundo yesekondari kanti amaProvinsi amaningi ahlinzeka intuthuko yezeprofeshini okwenziwa ngaphansi kophiko lukangqongqoshe wemfundo noma amabhodi ezikole noma izinhlangano ezingekho ngaphansi kukahulumeni.[15] Nangaphezu kwalokho, kukhona izinhlelo eziqondene nemfundo yabadala kulabo vele asebenza lo msebenzi, kumkhakha weze-akhademiki, ezenziwa emayunivesithi, emakholishi nasezinhlanganweni zamaprofeshini.[16] <br/>
