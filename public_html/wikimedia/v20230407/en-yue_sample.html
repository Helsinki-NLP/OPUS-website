The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested every year by franchise teams representing Indian cities. The league, founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) member Lalit Modi in 2007, is scheduled over April and May of every year.[3] The title sponsor of the IPL in 2016 is Vivo Electronics, thus the league is officially known as the Vivo Indian Premier League. <br/>
印度板球聯賽 (IPL) 係好專業既20數組別板球聯賽. 每一年既比賽會係印度好多個城市入面進行.聯賽係由一個組織叫 Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) 來舉行, 由2007年開始勆為 Board of Control of Cricket in India 其中一個成員, 聯賽會由四月到下一年既五月.[3] 係2006年,佢地個冠名贊助商係 Vivo Electronics, 所以佢地改左個名叫 Vivo Indian Premier League. <br/>

Points in the polar coordinate system with pole O and polar axis L. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees or (3,60°). In blue, the point (4,210°). <br/>
不同既點在極坐標系統同極O 和極軸 L. 當綠色部份中的點, 它的位置為徑向座標係3同角落係60度或者 (3,60°). 藍色部份中的點係 (4,210°). <br/>
<hr/>
In mathematics, the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction. <br/>
數學入面既極坐標係兩個方向的坐標系統. 每一個點會係一個平面上並決定佢既距離由初始點貼佢既角度由初始既方向. <br/>
<hr/>
The reference point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.[1] <br/>
初始點係叫極點同 一條射線我地叫佢係徑向座標. 距離由極射出就叫徑向坐標或半徑, 同佢地既角度係叫做角坐標，極角或方位角.[1] <br/>

The first 15,000 partial sums of 0 + 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... <br/>
1到15,000 總和利用下列數列0 + 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... <br/>
<hr/>
In mathematics, 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ··· is the infinite series whose terms are the successive positive integers, given alternating signs. Using sigma summation notation the sum of the first m terms of the series can be expressed as <br/>
係數學入面, 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ··· 係無限數列同佢係連續正指數, 佢既數列比左一個特別的標誌. 可以利用 sigma加數符號由第一項加到第m項可以理解成, <br/>
<hr/>
The infinite series diverges, meaning that its sequence of partial sums, (1, −1, 2, −2, ...), does not tend towards any finite limit. Nonetheless, in the mid-18th century, Leonhard Euler wrote what he admitted to be a paradoxical equation: <br/>
發散無限數列係部份總和, (1,-1,2,-2,...) 數列會去到無限大同無限細.係十八世紀, Leonhard Euler 寫出一個自相矛盾的公式. <br/>
<hr/>
The series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is closely related to Grandi's series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + .... Euler treated these two as special cases of 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + ... for arbitrary n, a line of research extending his work on the Basel problem and leading towards the functional equations of what are now known as the Dirichlet eta function and the Riemann zeta function. <br/>
上面哥個無限數列1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... 係好接近 Grandi's series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + .... Euler 得出兩個無限數列既情況 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + ... 任意既 n. <br/>

The Tunnel Railway (also known as the Ramsgate Cliff Railway, the Ramsgate Tunnel Railway, the Ramsgate Underground Railway and the World Scenic Railway) was a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge underground railway in Ramsgate, Kent, England. Following the restructuring of railway lines in Ramsgate in 1926, the section of line between Broadstairs and Ramsgate Harbour including the tunnel was abandoned. This narrow gauge railway was opened in 1936 to connect tourist attractions and shops near Ramsgate harbour with the new railway main line at Dumpton Park. <br/>
鐵路隧道 (佢另一個名叫做拉姆斯蓋特懸崖鐵路,拉姆斯蓋地底鐵路同世界風景區鐵路) 係兩英尺英寸 (610毫米) 既窄軌地下鐵道係拉姆斯蓋特, 根德郡, 英格蘭. 係1926年重新建造既鐵路線在布羅德斯泰斯和拉姆斯蓋特港之間包括這條 鐵路隧道. <br/>

Line 2 (Shekou) (simplified Chinese: 二号线; traditional Chinese: 二號線; pinyin: Èrhào Xiàn; Jyutping: Ji6 Hou6 Sin3), also known as Shekou Line(Chinese: 蛇口線; Jyutping: Se4 Hau2 Sin3), of the Shenzhen Metro runs eastward from Chiwan to Window of the World. It opened on 28 December 2010.[1][2] <br/>
深圳地鐵二號線（粵拼:Ji6 Hou6 Sin3），又叫做蛇口線（Se4 Hau2 Sin3）係深圳地鐵嘅線路。蛇口線大致上係東西走向，西起赤灣，東至新秀，亦係唯一一條祇在原深圳特區內行駛嘅線路。蛇口線連接深圳市中心同蛇口港、後海發展區、世界之窗、華僑城、景田、東部嘅黃貝嶺、新秀呢啲地方。 本線路嘅長度係三十六公里，有廿九個站。 <br/>
<hr/>
Line 2 is the only line in Shenzhen solely with underground stations that are inclusively in Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. However, it is the least used line in the system with only 247,500[3] passengers a day, peaking at 385,500 on 5 May 2014.[4] <br/>
雖然蛇口線穿過深圳特區，局部同羅寶線平行，本來設想可以幫羅寶線分流，但好多站附近都唔夠人口，人流淨係得二十至五十萬一日，係幾條線路中最少人流嘅。 <br/>
