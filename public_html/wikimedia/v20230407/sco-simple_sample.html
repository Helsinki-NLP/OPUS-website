The people who abuse children are often known to them—such as parents, other relatives, and friends—and are not strangers.[10] One research study found that half the adults convicted of child sexual abuse of children outside of their family were also sexually abusing their own children.[11] <br/>
<hr/>
Medical researchers dinna ken hou many fowk in the population are pædophiles.[1] Thir is acause it is hard tae study fowk's feelings an desires unless thay actually shaw that thay hae thon feelins. <br/>
Medical researchers do not know how many people in the population are pedophiles.[12] This is because it is hard to study people's feelings and desires unless they actually show that they have those feelings. <br/>
<hr/>
For ordinar, the ainlie pædophiles that can be studied are thon that hae baithraken the law an bin catcht an convictit o sexually maltreatin bairns. <br/>
Generally, the only pedophiles who can be studied are those who have both broken the law and been caught and convicted of child sexual abuse. <br/>
<hr/>
A saecon raison is that whan an adult or teenager sexually maltreats a bairn, fowk aft call the abuser a pædophile, but it is possible that the maltreatment happenit fur a sindèrie raison, sic as the unavailabeelity o an adult ipartner. <br/>
A second reason is that when an adult or teenager sexually abuses a child, people often call the abuser a "pedophile", but it is possible that the abuse happened for a different reason, such as the unavailability of an adult partner. <br/>
<hr/>
Experts for ordinar define a bodie as a pædophile ainlie gin thay are primarily or ainlie sexually attractit tae pre-pubescent childer.[2][3][4][5] Gin a bodie sexually abuses a pre-pubescent child tae frichten or punish thaim, fur ensample, then it mey na be true pædophile behaviour. <br/>
Experts generally define a person as a pedophile only if they are primarily or exclusively sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.[2][3][4][5] If a person sexually abuses a pre-pubescent child to frighten or punish them, for example, then it may not be true pedophile behavior. <br/>
<hr/>
Some soorces, sic as the mayo clinic, report that maist sexual maltreatment o pre-pubescent bairns is committit bi pædophiles,[1] while ither studies report that maist fowk that sexually maltreat bairns arena pædophiles.[2] Accordin tae some studies, aroon 1% o aw adult men micht be pædophiles.[3] <br/>
Some sources, such as the Mayo Clinic, report that most child sexual abuse of pre-pubescent children is committed by pedophiles,[13] while other studies report that most people who sexually abuse children are not pedophiles.[14] According to some studies, about 1% of all adult males may be pedophiles.[15] <br/>
<hr/>
Maist doctors believe that pedophilia canna be cuired.[1] The current approach tae deal wi pædophiles that hae bin convictit o sexual maltreatment is tae try tae chynge thair behaviour. <br/>
As of 2008, most doctors believe that pedophilia cannot be cured.[16] The current approach to deal with pedophiles who have been convicted of sexual abuse is to try to change their behavior. <br/>
<hr/>
It daesna chynge thair sexual attraction. <br/>
It does not change their sexual attraction. <br/>
<hr/>
Usin thir treatment, it is believit that a few sex offenders can be hindered fae offendin agin. <br/>
Using this treatment, it is believed that some sex offenders can be prevented from offending again. <br/>
<hr/>
Medications sic as Pepo-Provera can be usit tae treat pædophilia.[2] <br/>
Medications such as Depo-Provera can be used to treat pedophilia.[17] <br/>
<hr/>
A bodie wi pædophilia is cried a pædophile. The child maun be least five yeir yunger than the bodie in the case o adolescent pædophiles afore the attraction can be cried pædophilia.[1] Adults whase primar sexual attraction is fur aerlie adolescents are properly cried hebephiles, na pedophiles. <br/>
A person with pedophilia is called a pedophile. The child must be at least five years younger than the person in the case of adolescent pedophiles before the attraction can be called pedophilia.[1] Adults whose primary sexual attraction is for early adolescents are properly called hebephiles, not pedophiles. <br/>
