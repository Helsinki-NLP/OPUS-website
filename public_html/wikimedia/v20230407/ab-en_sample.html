პოენიკიანი gaml არაბული ǧīm ებრაყლი gimel ბერძნული Gamma ეტრუსკანი C ძველი ლათინური C (G) <br/>
Phoenician gaml Arabic ǧīm Hebrew gimel Greek Gamma Etruscan C Old Latin C (G) <br/>
<hr/>
"C" მოდის იმავე წერილში, როგორც "G". სემიტებმა დაასახელა ეს გემი. ნიშანი შესაძლოა ადაპტირებული იყოს ეგვიპტური იეროგლიფისგან პერსონალის სლინგისთვის, რომელიც შეიძლება ყოფილიყო სახელი გეიმელის მნიშვნელობა. კიდევ ერთი შესაძლებლობა ის არის, რომ იგი ასახავდა აქლემი, სემიტური სახელი, რომელიც gamal იყო. წერილობითი ისტორიის სპეციალისტი ბერი ბ. პაუელი ამბობს: "ძნელი წარმოსადგენია, თუ როგორ აიღო აქლემი =" აქლემი "აქლემის სურათზე (შეიძლება მისი კეხი ან მისი თავი და კისერი!)" [2] <br/>
The sign is possibly adapted from an Egyptian hieroglyph for a staff sling, which may have been the meaning of the name gimel. Another possibility is that it depicted a camel, the Semitic name for which was gamal. Barry B. Powell, a specialist in the history of writing, states "It is hard to imagine how gimel = "camel" can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)".[2] <br/>
<hr/>
Etruscan ენაში, plosive consonants არ ჰქონდა კონტრასტული ხმაური, ამიტომ ბერძნული "Γ" (გამა) მიღებულ იქნა Etruscan ანბანი წარმოადგინოს / k /. უკვე დასავლეთით ბერძნულ ანბანში, გამა პირველი "ადრეული ეტრუსკანში", მაშინ "კლასიკური ეტრუსკანში" მიიღო. ლათინურად იგი საბოლოოდ აიღო "გ" ფორმა კლასიკურ ლათინურ ენაზე. ადრეული ლათინურ წარწერებში, ასოები 'კ ~ q' გამოყენებულ იქნა ჟღერს / კ / და / ɡ / (რომელიც არ იყო დიფერენცირებული წერილობით). ამ "q" გამოყენებული იყო / k / ან / ɡ / წარმოგიდგენთ მომრგვალებული ხმოვნებამდე, 'k' ადრე 'a' და 'c' სხვაგან. მე -3 საუკუნეში ძვ.წ. / ɡ / დაინერგა მოდიფიცირებული ხასიათი და "გ" შენახული იყო / k /. 'გ' და მისი ვარიანტის '' გ '' - ის გამოყენება '' 'და' '' q- ის უმეტესობა შეცვალა. აქედან გამომდინარე, კლასიკურ პერიოდში და შემდეგ "გ" განიხილებოდა, როგორც ბერძნული გამა, და "გ", როგორც კაპას ეკვივალენტი; ეს გვიჩვენებს ბერძნული სიტყვების romanization, როგორც 'ΚΑΔΜΟΣ', 'ΚΥΡΟΣ', ​​და 'ΦΩΚΙΣ' შევიდა ლათინური როგორც "cadmvs", "cyrvs" და "phocis", შესაბამისად. <br/>
Of these, 'q' was used to represent /k/ or /ɡ/ before a rounded vowel, 'k' before 'a', and 'c' elsewhere.[3] During the 3rd century BC, a modified character was introduced for /ɡ/, and 'c' itself was retained for /k/. The use of 'c' (and its variant 'g') replaced most usages of 'k' and 'q'. Hence, in the classical period and after, 'g' was treated as the equivalent of Greek gamma, and 'c' as the equivalent of kappa; this shows in the romanization of Greek words, as in 'ΚΑΔΜΟΣ', 'ΚΥΡΟΣ', and 'ΦΩΚΙΣ' came into Latin as 'cadmvs', 'cyrvs' and 'phocis', respectively. <br/>
<hr/>
სხვა დამწერებლებს აქვთ ჰომოლიფური ასოები "გ", მაგრამ არა ანალოგიური გამოყენება და წარმოება, ისევე როგორც კირილეული ასო Es (С, с), რომელიც მომდინარეობს ცუნამის სიგმადან, სახელწოდებით ნახევარმთვარის მთვარის გამო. <br/>
Other alphabets have letters homoglyphic to 'c' but not analogous in use and derivation, like the Cyrillic letter Es (С, с) which derives from the lunate sigma, named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon. <br/>

In 2002, it expanded to 1,147 units, which included stores in San Leandro, Fremont, and Hayward, California, and sales reached $37.4 billion.[1] Most of those locations replaced former Montgomery Ward locations, which closed in 2001. In 2003, Target reached 1,225 units and $42.0 billion in sales.[19] Despite the growth of the discount retailer, neither Marshall Field's nor Mervyn's were adding to its store count, and their earnings were consistently declining. Marshall Field's sold two of its stores in Columbus, Ohio, this year.[2] On June 9, 2004, Target Corporation announced its sale of the Marshall Field's chain to St. Louis-based May Department Stores, which would become effective July 31, 2004. <br/>
