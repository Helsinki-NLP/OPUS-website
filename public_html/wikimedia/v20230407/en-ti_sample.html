He has a son named Robby with his ex-wife Shannon Keene, but he abandoned them both when Robby was born and Johnny's mother Laura died on the same day.

The krar ( ክራር in Tigrinya,Tigre and Amharic), kirar, kerar, kraar is a five- or six-stringed bowl-shaped lyre from Eritrea[1] and Ethiopia. It is tuned to a pentatonic scale. A modern krar may be amplified, much in the same way as an electric guitar or violin. <br/>

Cush or Kush (/kʊʃ, kʌʃ/ Hebrew: כּוּשׁ‎ Hebrew pronunciation: [ˈkuʃ], Kush; Ge'ez: ኩሽ) was the oldest son of Ham and a grandson of Noah. He was the brother of Canaan, Mizraim and Phut. Cush was the father of Nimrod, a king called the “first heroic warrior on earth“.[1][2] <br/>

Cush is traditionally considered the ancestor of the "land of Cush," an ancient territory believed to have been located near the Red Sea. Cush is identified in the Bible with the Kingdom of Kush or ancient Ethiopia.[3] The Cushitic languages are named after Cush. <br/>

1770, wrote of "a tradition among the Abyssinians, which they say they have had since time immemorial", that in the days after the Deluge, Cush, the son of Ham, traveled with his family up the Nile until they reached the Atbara plain, then still uninhabited, from where they could see the Ethiopian table-land. There they ascended and built Axum, and sometime later returned to the lowland, building Meroë. He also states that European scholars of his own day had summarily rejected this account on grounds of their established theory, that Cush must have arrived in Africa via Arabia and the Bab-el-Mandeb, a strait located between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, and Djibouti and Eritrea on the Horn of Africa.[13] Further, the great obelisk of Axum was said to have been erected by Cush in order to mark his allotted territory, and his son Ityopp'is was said to have been buried there, according to the Book of Aksum, which Bruce asserts was revered throughout Abyssinia equally with the Kebra Nagast. <br/>

Cush is a Hebrew name that is possibly derived from Kash, the Egyptian name of Lower Nubia and later of the Nubian kingdom at Napata, known as the Kingdom of Kush.[6] <br/>

The form Kush appears in Egyptian records as early as the reign of Mentuhotep II (21st century BC), in an inscription detailing his campaigns against the Nubian region.[7] At the time of the compilation of the Hebrew Bible, and throughout classical antiquity, the Nubian kingdom was centered at Meroë in the modern-day nation of Sudan.[2] <br/>

Fascist mysticism (Italian: Mistica fascista) was a current of political and religious thought in Fascist Italy, based on Fideism,[1][2][3] a belief that faith existed without reason, and that Fascism should be based on a mythology and spiritual mysticism. <br/>
ፋሽስታዊ ፅውፅዋይ ወይ ምስጢራዊ እምነት (ብጣልያንኛ፦ Mistica fascista) was a current of political and religious thought in Fascist Italy, based on Fideism,[1][2][3] a belief that faith existed without reason, and that Fascism should be based on a mythology and spiritual mysticism. <br/>
<hr/>
The principles of mystical fascism were largely formulated by Niccolo Giani and a small group of young Fascists bound to the teachers at the School of Fascist Mysticism (including Guido Pallotta and Berto Ricci), some high-ranking (including Ferdinand Mezzasoma, Giuseppe Bottai), by writers and journalists of proven Fascist faith (Telesio Interlandi, Virginio Gayda) and Benito Mussolini.[12] It ultimately traced the cultural lines that were followed in the development of "Fascist" disciplines and guidelines pertaining to the policies of the School of Fascist Mysticism. <br/>

Niccolò Giani took the definition of mysticism from the writing of French philosopher Louis Rougier: <br/>

<hr/>
The establishment of the School was made to allow his followers to devote themselves fully to the worship of Mussolini, meditating on the writings and speeches of Mussolini,[6] and living according to his words, in a spirit of absolute loyalty and unquestioningly, as specified in the article "Fascist mysticism" in the Political Dictionary edited by the National Fascist Party in 1940: <br/>

<hr/>
The use of the term "mysticism" provoked hostility from the Roman Catholic Church, which used the term in the sense of being strictly limited to the spiritual sphere, without any political influence.[7] But in Giani's conception of mysticism, he claimed it was in the political sphere without fear of overlap between the two worlds. <br/>
