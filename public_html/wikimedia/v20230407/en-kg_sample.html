Gilley's article "The case for colonialism" was published in an advance online version of the Third World Quarterly in 2017, against the recommendation of its reviewers.[7] According to Gilley, colonialism was both objectively beneficial (the benefits outweighed the harms) and subjectively legitimate (it was accepted by large portions of local population). <br/>
Disolo ya Gilley "The case for colonialism" basikaka na version ya ntete ya internet ya Third World Quarterly na 2017, na kuwakana ve ti bangindu ya bantu yina ke tadilaka yo. Na kutadila Gilley, colonisation vandaka na mfunu mingi (mambote vandaka mingi kuluta bampasi) mpi na masonga yonso (bo ndimaka yo na bantu mingi ya kisika yina). <br/>
<hr/>
Consequently, the author calls for a revival of colonialism.[8] The article was controversial both for its argument and for its subsequent withdrawal, and resulted in a debate about academic standards and peer review. <br/>
Yo yina, nsoniki ke lomba kuvutukila koloni.[1] Disolo yango basisaka mavwanga sambu na ngindu na yo mpi sambu na kukatuka na yo na nima, mpi yo basisaka ntembe na yina me tala minsiku ya nzo-nkanda mpi kutadila ya banduku. <br/>
<hr/>
Fifteen members of the journal's board resigned over the issue.[9][10][11][12][7][13] Critics described the article as low-quality and said that it was published, over the objections of reviewers, as a form of academic clickbait.[7] The article was ultimately retracted with Gilley's assent and re-published in the conservative National Association of Scholars' journal Academic Questions in April 2018.[14][15] When asked if it would be ethical to publish a paper making a case for genocide, Gilley said, "I think everyone would agree, [genocide] is a moral wrong" but that he did not believe colonialism was a moral wrong. <br/>
Bantu kumi na tanu ya kimvuka ya zulunalu yambulaka kisalu sambu na diambu yina. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Bantu ya mayele tubaka nde disolo yango vandaka ya mbote ve mpi tubaka nde bo basisaka yo, na nima ya kubuya ya bantu yina ke tadilaka yo, bonso mutindu mosi ya mayele ya kulonguka.

Geographer Reuben Rose-Redwood argued that there is a documented connection between colonialism and genocide.[16][17] In the spring of 2022, Gilley responded to many of his critics in a second article entitled 'The Case for Colonialism: A Response to My Critics'.[18] <br/>

In 2017, Gilley withdrew from the American Political Science Association, stating that he considered it to lack intellectual diversity and to possess an anti-conservative bias.[22] A member of the Heterodox Academy, he has been critical of tenure evaluations which require a pledge to uphold collegiate diversity.[21] <br/>

Gilley's 2006 article "The meaning and measure of state legitimacy: results for 72 countries" introduced a novel multidimensional, quantitative measure of the qualitative concept of political legitimacy.[3][4][5] His work has since been extended by other scholars, and customized to specific geographical regions such as Latin America[4] and Europe.[5] Gilley himself has since updated his work on quantification of legitimacy with additional empirical data.[5][6] <br/>
