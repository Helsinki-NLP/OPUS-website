The Meitei calendar (Meitei: ꯃꯩꯇꯩ ꯊꯥꯄꯥꯂꯣꯟ) or Manipuri calendar (Meitei: ꯃꯅꯤꯄꯨꯔꯤ ꯊꯥꯄꯥꯂꯣꯟ) or Kangleipak calendar (Meitei: ꯀꯪꯂꯩꯄꯥꯛ ꯊꯥꯄꯥꯂꯣꯟ) or Maliyapham Palcha Kumshing (Meitei: ꯃꯂꯤꯌꯥꯐꯝ ꯄꯥꯜꯆꯥ ꯀꯨꯝꯁꯤꯡ) is a lunisolar calendar used by the Meitei people of Manipur for their religious as well as agricultural activities. The concept of era in Meitei was first developed by Emperor Maliyafam Palcha, in the year 1397 BC (Palcha Era)[1] in the kingdom of Kangleipak in present-day Manipur. It is believed that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th months of the Meitei calendar were named after Poireiten's agricultural activities. <br/>

The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union.[1][2] It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history both in terms of cost and casualties,[3] and is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. The initial emergency response, together with later decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles—roughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.[4][5] <br/>

The operators were able to only partially restore the specified test power, which put the reactor in an unstable condition. This risk was not made evident in the operating instructions, so the operators proceeded with the electrical test. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead.[2]:33 <br/>

A large amount of energy was suddenly released, and two explosions ruptured the reactor core and destroyed the reactor building. One was a highly destructive steam explosion from the vaporizing super-heated cooling water; the other explosion could have been another steam explosion or a small nuclear explosion, akin to a nuclear fizzle. This was immediately followed by an open-air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the USSR and Western Europe, especially Belarus, 16 km away, where around 70% landed,[8] before being finally contained on 4 May 1986.[9][10] The fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion.[4] As a result of rising ambient radiation levels off-site, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. <br/>

In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest personal computer software company.[6][lower-alpha 1] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect.[9] During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[10] In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.[11] He stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[4] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts including climate change, global health and development, and education.[13] <br/>
