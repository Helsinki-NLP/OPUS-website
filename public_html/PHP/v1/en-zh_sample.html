<hr>
(src)="s5.1"> This manual is written in XML using the DocBook XML DTD , using DSSSL ( Document Style and Semantics Specification Language ) for formatting , and experimentally the XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations ) for maintenance and formatting . <br>
(src)="s6.1"> Using XML as a source format gives us the ability to generate many output formats from the source files , while only maintaining one source document for all formats . <br>
(trg)="s1.1">º󍋼/A <br>
<hr>
(src)="s6.2"> The tools used for formatting HTML and TeX versions are Jade , written by James Clark and The Modular DocBook Stylesheets written by Norman Walsh . <br>
(trg)="s2.1">¸½¼ K. ¹ؓڱ¾ʖ²ἯTD <br>
<hr>
(src)="s6.3"> We use Microsoft HTML Help Workshop to generate the Windows HTML Help format of the manual , and of course PHP itself to do some additional conversions and formatting . <br>
(src)="s7.1"> You can download the manual in various languages and formats , including plain text , plain HTML , PDF , PalmPilot DOC , PalmPilot iSilo and Windows HTML Help , from http : / /www.php.net / docs.php . <br>

(trg)="s.1">PHP ʖ²ἯTH <br>
<hr>
(src)="s6.3"> You can view the manual in either its plain ( print-friendly ) HTML format or an HTML format that integrates the manual into the look and feel of the PHP website itself . <br>
(src)="s7.1"> An advantage of the online manual over most of the offline formats is the integration of user-contributed notes . <br>
(trg)="s1.1">º󍋼/A <br>
<hr>
(src)="s7.2"> An obvious disadvantage is that you have to be online to view the manual in the online formats . <br>
(src)="s8.1"> There are several offline formats of the manual , and the most appropriate format for you depends on what operating system you use and your personal reading style . <br>
(trg)="sabout.1">¸½¼ K. ¹ؓڱ¾ʖ²ἯA <br>
<hr>
(src)="s8.2"> For information on how the manual is generated in so many formats , read the ' How we generate the formats ' section of this appendix . <br>
(src)="s9.1"> The most cross-platform formats of the manual are the HTML and plain-text versions . <br>
(trg)="sabout.formats.1">ʖ²ᵄ¸񊽼/H1 <br>
<hr>
(src)="s9.2"> The HTML format is provided both as a single HTML file and as a package of individual files for each section ( which results in a collection of several thousand files ) . <br>
(src)="s9.3"> The HTML and plaintext formats are provided as tar files compressed using the bzip2 archiver . <br>
(trg)="s3.1">º󍋼/A <br>
<hr>
(src)="s10.1"> Another popular cross-platform format , and the format most suited to printing , is PDF ( also known as Adobe Acrobat ) . <br>
(src)="s10.2"> But before you rush to download this format and hit the Print button , be warned that the manual is nearly 2000 pages long , and constantly being revised . <br>
(trg)="s4.1">ưµ㼯A <br>
<hr>
(src)="s12.2"> You can bring your handheld with you on your daily commute and use a DOC or iSilo reader to brush up on your PHP knowledge , or just use it as a quick reference . <br>
(src)="s13.1"> For Windows platforms , the Windows HTML Help version of the manual soups up the HTML format for use with the Windows HTML Help application . <br>
