(src)="s.1">This manual is written in XML using the DocBook XML DTD , using DSSSL (Document Style and Semantics Specification Language) for formatting, and experimentaly the XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) for maintenance and formatting.<br>
(src)="s1.1">Using XML as a source format gives us the ability to generate many output formats from the source files, while only maintaining one source document for all formats. The tools used for formatting HTML and TeX versions are Jade , written by James Clark and The Modular DocBook Stylesheets written by Norman Walsh . We use Microsoft HTML Help Workshop to generate the Windows HTML Help format of the manual, and of course PHP itself to do some additional conversions and formatting.<br>

(src)="s.1">The PHP manual is provided in several formats. These formats can be divided into two groups: online readable formats, and downloadable packages.<br>
(src)="s1.1"> 참고: Some publishers have made available printed versions of this manual. We cannot recommend any of those, as they tend to become out-of-date very quickly.<br>
(trg)="s3.1">º󍋼/A <br>
<hr>
(src)="s2.1">You can read the manual online at http://www.php.net/ and on the numerous mirror sites. For best performance, you should choose the mirror site closest to you. You can view the manual in either its plain (print-friendly) HTML format or a an HTML format that integrates the manual into the look and feel of the PHP website itself.<br>
(src)="s3.1">An advantage of the online manual over most of the offline formats is the integration of user-contributed notes . An obvious disadvantage is that you have to be online to view the manual in the online formats.<br>
(trg)="s4.1">ưµ㼯A <br>
<hr>
(src)="s6.1">Another popular cross-platform format, and the format most suited to printing, is PDF (also known as Adobe Acrobat). But before you rush to download this format and hit the Print button, be warned that the manual is nearly 2000 pages long, and constantly being revised.<br>
(src)="s7.1"> 참고: If you do not already have a program capable of viewing PDF format files, you may need to download Adobe Acrobat Reader .<br>

(src)="s.1">This manual does not attempt to provide instruction about general programming practices. If you are a first-time, or even just a beginning, programmer, you may find it difficult to learn how to program in PHP using just this manual. You may want to seek out a text more oriented towards beginners. You can find a list of PHP-related books at http://www.php.net/books.php .<br>
(src)="s1.1">There are a number of active mailing lists for discussion of all aspects of programming with PHP. If you find yourself stuck on a problem for which you can't find your own solution, you may be able to get help from someone on these lists. You can find a list of the mailing lists at http://www.php.net/support.php , as well as links to the mailing list archives and other online support resources. Furthermore, at http://www.php.net/links.php there is a list of websites devoted to PHP articles, forums, and code galleries.<br>

(src)="s.1">The user-contributed notes play an important role in the development of this manual. By allowing readers of the manual to contribute examples, caveats, and further clarifications from their browser, we are able to incorporate that feedback into the main text of the manual. And until the notes have been incorporated, they can be viewed in their submitted form online and in some of the offline formats.<br>
(src)="s1.1"> 참고: The user-contributed notes are not moderated before they appear online, so the quality of the writing or code examples, and even the veracity of the contribution, cannot be guaranteed. (Not that there is any guarantee of the quality or accuracy of the manual text itself.)<br>
